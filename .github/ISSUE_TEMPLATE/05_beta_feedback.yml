        ## Thank you for providing feedback on our beta release!

        Before submission, we ask that you first [search existing issues](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Abeta-feedback) to see if someone else may have experienced the same issue or provided similar feedback. This helps to keep all relevant information in one place, including any potential workarounds.

        ### A Note on Terraform Core Issues

        We ask that you consider whether an issues may be related to Terraform Core. If you're experiencing issues similar to the following examples, we recommend [opening an issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/new/choose) in the Terraform Core repository instead:

        * [Configuration Language](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language) or resource ordering issues
        * [State](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state) and [State Backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/backend) issues
        * [Provisioner](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/syntax) issues
        * [Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) issues
        * Issues that span resources across multiple providers

        When reporting an issue with a beta release, use this section to describe what behavior should have happened that isn't currently. Note that there is a section later in the template for providing a sample configuration, so a short description is all that's necessary here.

        When providing more general feedback, use this section to describe that feedback.

        If applicable, provide a snippet of output logging that contains the error or panic. Note that here is a section later in the template for providing more complete debug output, so a small snippet is all that's necessary here.

        For convenience, we pre-populate this section with a [code fence](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) to help with formatting in the resulting issue. Placing the log output between the sets of backticks (\```) will result in a well-formatted issue.

        ## Providing Configurations and Logging

        When providing a reproduction configuration and/or debug logging, please paste, upload, or link to a file or [public Gist](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists) containing the relevant information. Files under 25MB may be [attached directly](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/attaching-files) in the relevant field. Files larger than this should be uploaded to a file hosting service and a link shared. For your security you can also encrypt the files using our [GPG public key](https://keybase.io/hashicorp).

        Configurations should be applyable with minimal modifications, and should not rely on external modules. This helps maintainers and contributors efficiently reproduce issues and implement acceptance tests to ensure any fixes do not regress.

        > [!WARNING]
        > Bug reports without a functional and standalone sample configuration may be closed without further investigation.
