        ## Thank you for providing feedback on our beta release!

        Before submission, we ask that you first [search existing issues](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Abeta-feedback) to see if someone else may have experienced the same issue or provided similar feedback. This helps to keep all relevant information in one place, including any potential workarounds.

        ### A Note on Terraform Core Issues

        We ask that you consider whether an issues may be related to Terraform Core. If you're experiencing issues similar to the following examples, we recommend [opening an issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/new/choose) in the Terraform Core repository instead:

        * [Configuration Language](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language) or resource ordering issues
        * [State](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state) and [State Backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/backend) issues
        * [Provisioner](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/syntax) issues
        * [Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) issues
        * Issues that span resources across multiple providers

      description: |
        When reporting an issue with a beta release, use this section to describe what behavior should have happened that isn't currently. Note that there is a section later in the template for providing a sample configuration, so a short description is all that's necessary here.

        When providing more general feedback, use this section to describe that feedback.

        If applicable, provide a snippet of output logging that contains the error or panic. Note that there is a section later in the template for providing more complete debug output, so a small snippet is all that's necessary here.

        For convenience, we pre-populate this section with a [code fence](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) to help with formatting in the resulting issue. Placing the log output between the sets of backticks (\```) will result in a well-formatted issue.

        ## Providing Configurations and Logging

        When providing a reproduction configuration and/or debug logging, please paste, upload, or link to a file or [public Gist](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists) containing the relevant information. Files under 25MB may be [attached directly](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/attaching-files) in the relevant field. Files larger than this should be uploaded to a file hosting service and a link shared. For your security you can also encrypt the files using our [GPG public key](https://keybase.io/hashicorp).

        Configurations should be applyable with minimal modifications, and should not rely on external modules. This helps maintainers and contributors efficiently reproduce issues and implement acceptance tests to prevent future regressions.

        > [!WARNING]
        > Bug reports without a functional and standalone sample configuration may be closed without further investigation.
