name: Request an Enhancement
description: Choose this option when you would like to request an enhancement to an existing resource or data source (such as the addition of new arguments), or to the provider itself.
labels:
  - enhancement
body:
  - type: markdown
    attributes:
      value: |
        ## Thank you for opening an enhancement request!

        This form is intended as a way to request additional functionality for existing resources, data sources, or the provider itself. This may include requests such as adding additional arguments or attributes enabled by upstream API changes, additional validation for arguments, etc.

        Before submitting an enhancement request, we ask that you first [search existing issues and pull requests](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues?q=label%3Aenhancement) to see if someone else has made a similar request or has already worked on adding the feature. This helps to keep all relevant discussions in one place.

        > [!NOTE]
        > If the absense of the requested feature is causing unexpected behavior in the provider, the [Report a Bug](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/new?template=00_bug_report.yml) form should be used. For entirely new resources, data sources, or services, please use the [Request Net New Functionality](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/new?template=03_new_functionality.yml) form.

      description: |
        If this request was implemented, what might the Terraform configuration look like? A best guess is helpful, even if you're unsure of exactly what the end result will look like. This helps maintainers and the community better understand how you (someone who is in need of this feature) envisions it.

        For convenience, we pre-populate this section with a [code fence](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) to help with formatting in the resulting issue. Configurations pasted between the backticks (\```) will have the appropriate syntax highlighting for HCL. Where appropriate, feel free to delete this.

        Where possible, please supply links to the [AWS Go SDK v2](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service) documentation demonstrating that the SDK supports the requested feature. Other links, such as those to the AWS API or CLI documentation, or other GitHub issues or pull requests that give additional context are also helpful.

      label: Would you like to implement the enhancement?
      description: |
        Indicate to the maintainers and community as to whether you plan to implement the enhancement yourself (you can update this later if you change your mind). This helps prevent duplication of effort, as many of our contributors look for recently filed issues as a source for their next contribution.

        If this would be your first contribution, refer to the [contributor guide](https://hashicorp.github.io/terraform-provider-aws/) for tips on getting started.
