        This form is for issues pertaining to the repository itself. This might include issues or changes related to GitHub Actions, labels, local development tools, procedures for maintaining the provider, etc. For issues with the contribution documentation, please use the [Report a Documentation Error](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/new?template=01_documentation.yml) form instead.

        Before submission, we ask that you first [search existing issues and pull requests](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues?q=label%3Arepository) to see if someone else has made a similar report or has alreaady worked on a relevant change.

        Indicate to the maintainers and community as to whether you plan to implement the change or fix for this (you can update this later if you change your mind). This helps prevent duplication of effort, as many of our contributors look for recently filed issues as a source for their next contribution.

        If this would be your first contribution, refer to the [contributor guide](https://hashicorp.github.io/terraform-provider-aws/) for tips on getting started.
