        ## Thank you for raising a bug report!

        Before submitting a bug report, we ask that you first [search existing issues and pull requests](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues?q=label%3Abug) to see if someone else may have experienced the same issue or may have already submitted a fix for it. This helps to keep all relevant information in one place, including any potential workarounds.

        ### A Note on Terraform Core Issues

        We also ask that you consider whether your issue may be related to Terraform Core. If you are running into one of the following scenarios, we recommend [opening an issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/new/choose) in the Terraform Core repository instead:

        * [Configuration Language](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language) or resource ordering issues
        * [State](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state) and [State Backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/backend) issues
        * [Provisioner](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/syntax) issues
        * [Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) issues
        * Issues that span resources across multiple providers

        Please run `terraform --version` to collect the Terraform and AWS Provider versions and paste the result below. If multiple versions have been tested, feel free to add that additional information here as well.

      description: |
        If applicable, provide a snippet of output logging that contains the error or panic. Note that there is a section later in the template for providing more complete debug output, so a small snippet is all that's necessary here.

        For convenience, we pre-populate this section with a [code fence](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) to help with formatting in the resulting issue. Placing the log output between the sets of backticks (\```) will result in a well-formatted issue.

        ## Providing Configurations and Logging

        When providing a reproduction configuration and/or debug logging, please paste, upload, or link to a file or [public Gist](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists) containing the relevant information. Files under 25MB may be [attached directly](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/attaching-files) in the relevant field. Files larger than this should be uploaded to a file hosting service and a link shared. For your security you can also encrypt the files using our [GPG public key](https://keybase.io/hashicorp).

        Configurations should be applyable with minimal modifications, and should not rely on external modules. This helps maintainers and contributors efficiently reproduce issues and implement acceptance tests to prevent future regressions.

        > [!WARNING]
        > Bug reports without a functional and standalone sample configuration may be closed without further investigation.

        Indicate to the maintainers and community as to whether you plan to implement a fix for this (you can update this later if you change your mind). This helps prevent duplication of effort, as many of our contributors look for recently filed issues as a source for their next contribution.

        If this would be your first contribution, refer to the [contributor guide](https://hashicorp.github.io/terraform-provider-aws/) for tips on getting started.
