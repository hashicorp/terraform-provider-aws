        ## Thank you for raising a documentation issue!

        This form is meant to alert the maintainers to issues with the provider documentation found on the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest) (such as resource and data source documentation, guides, and examples), or the [contributors guide](https://hashicorp.github.io/terraform-provider-aws/).

        We ask that you first [search existing issues and pull requests](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues?q=label%3Adocumentation) to see if someone else may have already noticed the same issue or has already submitted a fix for it.

        Indicate to the maintainers and community as to whether you plan to implement a fix for this (you can update this later if you change your mind). This helps prevent duplication of effort, as many of our contributors look for recently filed issues as a source for their next contribution.

        Documentation edits are generally a bit less involved, so are often a great entrypoint if you've ever been interested in contributing. If this would be your first contribution, refer to the [contributor guide](https://hashicorp.github.io/terraform-provider-aws/documentation-changes/) for tips on getting started.
