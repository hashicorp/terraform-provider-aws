        # Thank you for raising a documentation issue!

        This form is meant to alert the maintainers to an issue with the provider documentation found on the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest) (such as resource and data source documentation, guides and examples), as well as the [contribution guide](https://hashicorp.github.io/terraform-provider-aws/).

        Documentation edits are generally a bit less involved, so are often a great entrypoint if you've ever been interested in [contributing](https://hashicorp.github.io/terraform-provider-aws/documentation-changes/)!
