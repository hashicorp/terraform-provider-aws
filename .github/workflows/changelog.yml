            Please note that the `CHANGELOG.md` file contents are handled by the maintainers during merge. This is to prevent pull request merge conflicts, especially for contributions which may not be merged immediately. Please see the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/blob/main/docs/contributing) for additional pull request review items.

            Remove any changes to the `CHANGELOG.md` file and commit them in this pull request to prevent delays with reviewing and potentially merging this pull request.
