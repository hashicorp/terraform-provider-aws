## Community Maintainers

Members of the community who participate in any aspects of maintaining the provider must adhere to the HashiCorp [Community Guidelines](https://www.hashicorp.com/community-guidelines).

## Triage

Incoming issues are classified using labels. These are assigned either by automation, or manually during the triage process. We follow a two-label system where we classify by type and by the area of the provider they affect. A full listing of the labels and how they are used can be found in the [Label Dictionary](#label-dictionary).

## Pull Requests

### Pull Request Review Process

Throughout the review process our first priority is to interact with contributors with kindness, empathy and in accordance with the [Guidelines](https://www.hashicorp.com/community-guidelines) and [Principles](https://www.hashicorp.com/our-principles/) of Hashicorp.

Our contributors are often working within the provider as a hobby, or not in their main line of work so we need to give adequate time for response. By default this is a week, but it is worth considering taking on the work to complete the PR ourselves if the administrative effort of waiting for a response is greater than just resolving the issues ourselves (Don't wait the week, or add a context shift for yourself and the contributor to fix a typo). As long as we use their commits, contributions will be recorded by Github and as always ensure to thank the contributor for their work. Roadmap items are another area where we would consider taking on the work ourselves more quickly in order to meet the commitments made to our users.

Notes for each type of pull request are (or will be) available in subsections below.

- If you plan to be responsible for the pull request through the merge/closure process, assign it to yourself
- Add `bug`, `enhancement`, `new-data-source`, `new-resource`, or `technical-debt` labels to match expectations from change
- Perform a quick scan of open issues and ensure they are referenced in the pull request description (e.g., `Closes #1234`, `Relates #5678`). Edit the description yourself and mention this to the author:

```markdown
This pull request appears to be related to/solve #1234, so I have edited the pull request description to denote the issue reference.
```

- Review the contents of the pull request and ensure the change follows the relevant section of the [Contributing Guide](./contribution-checklists.md)
- If the change is not acceptable, leave a long form comment about the reasoning and close the pull request
- If the change is acceptable with modifications, leave a pull request review marked using the `Request Changes` option (for maintainer pull requests with minor modification requests, giving feedback with the `Approve` option is recommended so they do not need to wait for another round of review)
- If the author is unresponsive for changes (by default we give two weeks), determine importance and level of effort to finish the pull request yourself including their commits or close the pull request
- Run relevant acceptance testing ([locally](./running-and-writing-acceptance-tests.md) or in TeamCity) against AWS Commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) to ensure no new failures are being introduced
- Approve the pull request with a comment outlining what steps you took that ensure the change is acceptable, e.g., acceptance testing output

``````markdown
Looks good, thanks @username! :rocket:

Output from acceptance testing in AWS Commercial:

```
--- PASS: TestAcc...
--- PASS: TestAcc...
```

Output from acceptance testing in AWS GovCloud (US):

```
--- PASS: TestAcc...
--- PASS: TestAcc...
```

#### Dependency Updates

##### Go Default Version Update

This project typically upgrades its Go version for development and testing shortly after release to get the latest and greatest Go functionality. Before beginning the update process, ensure that you review the new version release notes to look for any areas of possible friction when updating.

Create an issue to cover the update noting down any areas of particular interest or friction.

Ensure that the following steps are tracked within the issue and completed within the resulting pull request.

- Update go version in `go.mod`
- Verify `make test lint` works as expected
- Verify `goreleaser build --snapshot` succeeds for all currently supported architectures
- Verify `goenv` support for the new version
- Update `development-environment.md`
- Update `.go-version`
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` detailing the update and mention any notes practitioners need to be aware of.

See [#9992](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/9992) / [#10206](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/pull/10206)  for a recent example.

##### AWS Go SDK Updates

Almost exclusively, `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go` updates are additive in nature. It is generally safe to only scan through them before approving and merging. If you have any concerns about any of the service client updates such as suspicious code removals in the update, or deprecations introduced, run the acceptance testing for potentially affected resources before merging.

Authentication changes:

Occasionally, there will be changes listed in the authentication pieces of the AWS Go SDK codebase, e.g., changes to `aws/session`. The AWS Go SDK `CHANGELOG` should include a relevant description of these changes under a heading such as `SDK Enhancements` or `SDK Bug Fixes`. If they seem worthy of a callout in the Terraform AWS Provider `CHANGELOG`, then upon merging we should include a similar message prefixed with the `provider` subsystem, e.g., `* provider: ...`.

Additionally, if a `CHANGELOG` addition seemed appropriate, this dependency and version should also be updated in the Terraform S3 Backend, which currently lives in Terraform Core. An example of this can be found with https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/pull/9305 and https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/22055.

CloudFront changes:

CloudFront service client updates have previously caused an issue when a new field introduced in the SDK was not included with Terraform and caused all requests to error (https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/4091). As a precaution, if you see CloudFront updates, run all the CloudFront resource acceptance testing before merging (`TestAccCloudFront`).

New Regions:

These are added to the AWS Go SDK `aws/endpoints/defaults.go` file and generally noted in the AWS Go SDK `CHANGELOG` as `aws/endpoints: Updated Regions`. Since April 2019, new regions added to AWS now require being explicitly enabled before they can be used. Examples of this can be found when `me-south-1` was announced:

- [Terraform AWS Provider issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/9545)
- [Terraform AWS Provider AWS Go SDK update pull request](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/pull/9538)
- [Terraform AWS Provider data source update pull request](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/pull/9547)
- [Terraform S3 Backend issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22254)
- [Terraform S3 Backend pull request](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/22253)

Typically our process for new regions is as follows:

- Create new (if not existing) Terraform AWS Provider issue: Support Automatic Region Validation for `XX-XXXXX-#` (Location)
- Create new (if not existing) Terraform S3 Backend issue: backend/s3: Support Automatic Region Validation for `XX-XXXXX-#` (Location)
- [Enable the new region in an AWS testing account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html#rande-manage-enable) and verify AWS Go SDK update works with the new region with `export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=XX-XXXXX-#` with the new region and run the `TestAccDataSourceAwsRegion_` acceptance testing or by building the provider and testing a configuration like the following:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "me-south-1"
}

data "aws_region" "current" {}

output "region" {
  value = data.aws_region.current.name
}
```

- Merge AWS Go SDK update in Terraform AWS Provider and close issue with the following information:

``````markdown
Support for automatic validation of this new region has been merged and will release with version <x.y.z> of the Terraform AWS Provider, later this week.

---

Please note that this new region requires [a manual process to enable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html#rande-manage-enable). Once enabled in the console, it takes a few minutes for everything to work properly.

If the region is not enabled properly, or the enablement process is still in progress, you can receive errors like these:

```console
$ terraform apply

Error: error validating provider credentials: error calling sts:GetCallerIdentity: InvalidClientTokenId: The security token included in the request is invalid.
    status code: 403, request id: 142f947b-b2c3-11e9-9959-c11ab17bcc63

  on main.tf line 1, in provider "aws":
   1: provider "aws" {
```

---

To use this new region before support has been added to Terraform AWS Provider version in use, you must disable the provider's automatic region validation via:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  # ... potentially other configuration ...

  region                 = "me-south-1"
  skip_region_validation = true
}
```
``````

- Update the Terraform AWS Provider `CHANGELOG` with the following:

```markdown
NOTES:

* provider: Region validation now automatically supports the new `XX-XXXXX-#` (Location) region. For AWS operations to work in the new region, the region must be explicitly enabled as outlined in the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html#rande-manage-enable). When the region is not enabled, the Terraform AWS Provider will return errors during credential validation (e.g., `error validating provider credentials: error calling sts:GetCallerIdentity: InvalidClientTokenId: The security token included in the request is invalid`) or AWS operations will throw their own errors (e.g., `data.aws_availability_zones.available: Error fetching Availability Zones: AuthFailure: AWS was not able to validate the provided access credentials`). [GH-####]

ENHANCEMENTS:

* provider: Support automatic region validation for `XX-XXXXX-#` [GH-####]
```

- Follow the [Contributing Guide](./contribution-checklists.md#new-region) to submit updates for various data sources to support the new region
- Submit the dependency update to the Terraform S3 Backend by running the following:

```shell
go get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go@v#.#.#
go mod tidy
```

- Create a S3 Bucket in the new region and verify AWS Go SDK update works with new region by building the Terraform S3 Backend and testing a configuration like the following:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "XXX"
    key    = "test"
    region = "me-south-1"
  }
}

output "test" {
  value = timestamp()
}
```

- After approval, merge AWS Go SDK update in Terraform S3 Backend and close issue with the following information:

``````markdown
Support for automatic validation of this new region has been merged and will release with the next version of the Terraform.

This was verified on a build of Terraform with the update:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "XXX"
    key    = "test"
    region = "me-south-1"
  }
}

output "test" {
  value = timestamp()
}
```

Outputs:

```console
$ terraform init
...
Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```

---

Please note that this new region requires [a manual process to enable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html#rande-manage-enable). Once enabled in the console, it takes a few minutes for everything to work properly.

If the region is not enabled properly, or the enablement process is still in progress, you can receive errors like these:

```console
$ terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Error: error validating provider credentials: error calling sts:GetCallerIdentity: InvalidClientTokenId: The security token included in the request is invalid.
```

---

To use this new region before this update is released, you must disable the Terraform S3 Backend's automatic region validation via:

```hcl
terraform {
  # ... potentially other configuration ...

  backend "s3" {
    # ... other configuration ...

    region                 = "me-south-1"
    skip_region_validation = true
  }
}
```
``````

- Update the Terraform S3 Backend `CHANGELOG` with the following:

```markdown
NOTES:

* backend/s3: Region validation now automatically supports the new `XX-XXXXX-#` (Location) region. For AWS operations to work in the new region, the region must be explicitly enabled as outlined in the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html#rande-manage-enable). When the region is not enabled, the Terraform S3 Backend will return errors during credential validation (e.g., `error validating provider credentials: error calling sts:GetCallerIdentity: InvalidClientTokenId: The security token included in the request is invalid`).

### Pull Request Merge Process

- Add this pull request to the upcoming release milestone
- Add any linked issues that will be closed by the pull request to the same upcoming release milestone
- Merge the pull request
- Delete the branch (if the branch is on this repository)
- Determine if the pull request should have a CHANGELOG entry by reviewing the [Pull Request Types to CHANGELOG section](./pullrequest-submission-and-lifecycle.md#pull-request-types-to-changelog), and follow the CHANGELOG specification [here](./pullrequest-submission-and-lifecycle.md#changelog-process)
- Leave a comment on any issues closed by the pull request noting that it has been merged and when to expect the release containing it, e.g.

```markdown
The fix for this has been merged and will release with version X.Y.Z of the Terraform AWS Provider, expected in the XXX timeframe.
```

## Breaking Changes

When breaking changes to the provider are necessary we release them in a major version. If an issue or PR necessitates a breaking change, then the following procedure should be observed:

- Add the `breaking-change` label.
- Add the issue/PR to the next major version milestone.
- Leave a comment why this is a breaking change or otherwise only being considered for a major version update. If possible, detail any changes that might be made for the contributor to accomplish the task without a breaking change.

## Release Process

- Create a milestone for the next release after this release (generally, the next milestone will be a minor version increase unless previously decided for a major or patch version)
- Check the existing release milestone for open items and either work through them or move them to the next milestone
- Run the HashiCorp (non-OSS) TeamCity release job either via:
    - Slack command: `/tcrelease aws #.#.#` (no `v` prefix)
    - Web interface: With the `DEPLOYMENT_TARGET_VERSION` matching the expected release milestone and `DEPLOYMENT_NEXT_VERSION` matching the next release milestone
- Wait for the TeamCity release job to complete either by watching the build logs or Slack notifications
- Close the release milestone
- Create a new GitHub release with the release title exactly matching the tag and milestone (e.g., `v2.22.0`) and copy the entries from the CHANGELOG to the release notes.
