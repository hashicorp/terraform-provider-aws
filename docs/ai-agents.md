# AI Agents

The `AI Agent Guides` section on the navbar serves as an index of documents which can be provided to AI agents as context to solve specific tasks.
The following points should be taken into consideration when developing new guides.

- Use generalized instructions and remain tool agnostic.
- Limit scope to a single task per document.
- Structure documents so they are useful to both AI agents and human readers.
