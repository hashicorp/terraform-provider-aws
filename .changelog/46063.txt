```release-note:enhancement
resource/aws_servicequotas_service_quota: Add `wait_for_fulfillment` argument to wait for quota increase request approval and for the desired quota value to be enacted before completing resource creation. Also supports custom timeouts for when cases take longer than the default (10m) to pass through.
