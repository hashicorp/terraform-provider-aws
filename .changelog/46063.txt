```release-note:enhancement
resource/aws_servicequotas_service_quota: Add `wait_for_fulfillment` argument to wait for quota increase request approval and for the desired quota value to be enacted before completing resource creation. Support edge case for updating a quota and the desired value is already satisfied to reduce case creation churn. Also supports custom timeouts for when cases take longer than the default (10m) to pass through.
