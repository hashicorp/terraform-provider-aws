```release-note:bug
resource/aws_elasticache_replication_group: Fixed an issue with downscaling `aws_elasticache_replication_group` when `cluster_mode="enabled"` and `num_node_groups` is reduced. Previously, downscaling could fail in certain scenarios; for example, if nodes `0001`, `0002`, `0003`, `0004`, and `0005` exist, and a user manually removes `0003` and `0005`, then sets `num_node_groups = 2`, terraform would attempt to delete `0003`, `0004`, and `0005`. This is now fixed, after this fix terraform will retrieve the current node groups before resizing.
