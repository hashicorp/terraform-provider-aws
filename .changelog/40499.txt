```release-note:enhancement
resource/aws_kinesis_stream: Add plan-time validation that creation of an on-demand stream would not exceed the AWS account's [data stream quota](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html), preventing the provider from retrying for 1 hour in the case that the quota is exceeded. This functionality requires the `kinesis:DescribeLimits` IAM permission
```
