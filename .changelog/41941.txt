```release-note:breaking-change
provider: The `aws_redshift_service_account` resource has been removed. AWS [recommends](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/db-auditing.html#db-auditing-bucket-permissions) that a [service principal name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html#principal-services) should be used instead of an AWS account ID in any relevant IAM policy
