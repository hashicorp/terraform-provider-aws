```release-note:bug
resource/aws_instance: Fixed issues with `volume_tags`, `root_block_device.*.tags`, and `ebs_block_device.*.tags` where tags overlapped with default tags. These are now handled consistently with top-level tags throughout the provider. Specifically, tags defined in both locations are no longer removed, preventing erroneous differences.
