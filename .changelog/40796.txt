```release-note:enhancement
resource/aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration: `rule.noncurrent_version_expiration.noncurrent_days` and `rule.noncurrent_version_transition.noncurrent_days` are Required. Technically this is a breaking change, but failure to configure this attribute would have led to `InvalidArgument` or `MalformedXML` errors
