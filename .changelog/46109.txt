```release-note:bug
resource/aws_elasticache_replication_group: Fixed, ability to update engine and engine_version of aws_elasticache_replication_group after removing /disassociating it from aws_elasticache_global_replication_group .
Previously, aws_elasticache_replication_group was ignoring any changes to engine or engine version if it had ever been part of aws_elasticache_global_replication_group / Global Datastore.
