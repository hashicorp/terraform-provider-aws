```release-note:bug
provider: Change the default AWS SDK for Go v2 API client [`RateLimiter`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws/retry#RateLimiter) to [`ratelimit.None`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws/ratelimit#pkg-variables) so that services migrated to AWS SDK for Go v2 maintain behavioral compatibility with AWS SDK for Go v1
