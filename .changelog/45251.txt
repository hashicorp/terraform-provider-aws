```
```release-note:note
resource/aws_s3_bucket: To support ABAC (Attribute Based Access Control) in general purpose buckets, this resource will now attempt to send tags in the create request and use the S3 Control tagging APIs [`TagResource`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_TagResource.html), [`UntagResource`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_UntagResource.html), and [`ListTagsForResource`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_ListTagsForResource.html) for read and update operations. The calling principal must have the corresponding `s3:TagResource`, `s3:UntagResource`, and `s3:ListTagsForResource` [IAM permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazons3.html#amazons3-actions-as-permissions). If the principal lacks the appropriate permissions, the provider will fall back to tagging after creation and using the S3 tagging APIs [`PutBucketTagging`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketTagging.html), [`DeleteBucketTagging`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucketTagging.html), and [`GetBucketTagging`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketTagging.html) instead. With ABAC enabled, tag modifications may fail with the fall back behavior. See the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/buckets-tagging-enable-abac.html) for additional details on enabling ABAC in general purpose buckets.
