# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is the Go-based Terraform AWS Provider (`github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws`). It maps AWS API resources to Terraform resources, data sources, ephemeral resources and actions (collectively often referred to as just resources). The primary language is Go; HCL appears in acceptance test configurations and website documentation.

## Agent Registry

This project uses specialized personas for different tasks.

### Available Personas
- **`@contributor`**: [Contributor Persona](./.agents/contributor.md) - Contributes code in the form of bugfixes, enhancements to existing resources, and new resources. Makes clarifications and corrections to existing documentation.
- **`@maintainer`**: [Maintainer Persona](./.agents/maintainer.md) - Steward of the project, responsible for both internal and external quality. Reviews contributions. Maintains provider-level features, including new Terraform language constructs.
- **`@tcm`**: [TCM Persona](./.agents/tcm.md) - Triages incoming GitHub issues and PRs. Engages with community members to answer technical and process questions. Suggests workarounds and alternatives to reported bugs.

### Global Rules
- Always use the requested persona for tasks.
- If no persona is specified, default to `@contributor`.
- A persona defines a role with a perspective and responsibilities.
- Personas may invoke skills.

## Global Rules

### Non-negotiables
- Verification is a hard exit criterion for every task. Without it, the task is not done.
- Prefer the boring, obvious solution.
- Touch only what you’re asked to touch.

### AI Usage Policy

Per `docs/ai-usage.md`:
- Disclose AI use in the PR description.
- Include `🤖🤖🤖` in the PR title if an LLM agent is directly involved in submitting it.
- The human PR author is fully responsible for all submitted code and must understand it completely.
- Human reviewers own the final code and must understand it fully.

## Guiding Principles

### Follow existing conventions
Consistency is key to maintaining a readable and maintainable codebase.
Before writing any code, analyze the existing codebase to understand and adopt its naming conventions, coding style, and language usage.

### Avoid code duplication and minimize dependencies
This repository contains a comprehensive set of utility packages. Look for opportunities to use them before writing new code.
- Look in the `internal/` directory (excluding `internal/generate/` and `internal/services/`) for broadly reusable utilities
- Only add new dependencies as a last resort, or when explicitly requested

### Code quality must not be compromised
- Every change must build successfully and pass all tests. Use `make test` to run unit tests.
- Code must be lint-free. Use `make lint` to check for linting issues.

## Additional Guidelines

### Go language usage
- TODO some things we always want

### Code generation
- Run `make gen` after making changes to any annotations (`// @...` comments in Go files), any `internal/service/*/generate.go` source files, or `names/data/names_data.hcl`.

### Working in the repository

#### Running commands
- Confirm that any commands you intend to run are safe before running them.
- Commands that are safe to run in the repository are:
  - Any command that invokes `make`.
  - Any command that invokes `go`.
- Do not prompt for confirmation before running any of the safe commands above.
  - Any other commands may be unsafe and should not be run without confirmation.

#### Running tests
- Every PR must leave tests in a passing state. This is non-negotiable.
- All existing tests must pass.
  - Use `make test` to run unit tests.
  - If your change breaks an existing test, fix it.
- TODO acceptance tests?
  - New features require new tests.
- CI is the gate. Run `make ci`.
  - PRs with failing tests do not merge.

### Documentation Checklist
- Authoritative reference: `./docs/end-user-documentation.md`.
- New features require new documentation.
- Correct spelling and grammar are important.
- Run `make tfproviderdocs`.

### Copyright headers
- All applicable files must have a copyright header.
- Run `make copyright-fix` to ensure headers are correct.

### Commit messages
- Each commit should be small and address a single change.
- The commit message describes the change.

### CHANGELOG entries
- CHANGELOG entries are required for:
  - New resources, data sources, ephemeral resources, action, list resources and functions.
  - Bug fixes.
  - Enhancements.
- Do not edit `CHANGELOG.md` directly.
- TODO
