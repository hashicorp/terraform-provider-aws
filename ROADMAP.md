# Roadmap:  October 2025 - December 2025

Every few months, the team will highlight areas of focus for our work and upcoming research.

We select items for inclusion in the roadmap from the Top Community Issues, [Core Services](https://hashicorp.github.io/terraform-provider-aws/core-services/), and internal priorities. Where community sourced contributions exist we will work with the authors to review and merge their work. Where this does not exist or the original contributors are not available we will create the resources and implementation ourselves.

Each weekly release will include necessary tasks that lead to the completion of the stated goals as well as community pull requests, enhancements, and features that are not highlighted in the roadmap.

This roadmap does not describe all the work that will be included within this timeframe, but it does describe our focus. We will include other work as events occur.

In the period spanning July to September 2025 the AWS Provider added support for the following (among many others):

- Oracle Database on AWS
- DynamoDB Warm Throughput
- Amazon Workspaces Web

From October - December 2025, we will be prioritizing the following areas of work (and more):
