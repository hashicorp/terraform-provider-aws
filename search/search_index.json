Data Source Let your Terraform configurations use data from resources not under local management by creating ready only data sources. Services Allow Terraform (via the AWS Provider) to manage an entirely new AWS service by introducing the resources and data sources required to manage configuration of the service. AWS Region New regions are immediately usable with the provider with the caveat that a configuration workaround is required to skip validation of the region during cli operations. A small set of changes are required to make this workaround necessary. Resource Name Generation Allow a resource to either fully, or partially, generate its own resource names. This can be useful in cases where the resource name uniquely identifies the resource and it needs to be recreated. It can also be used when a name is required, but the specific name is not important. Tagging Support Many AWS resources allow assigning metadata via tags. However, frequently AWS services are launched without tagging support so this will often need to be added later. Import Support Adding import support allows <code>terraform import</code> to be run targeting an existing unmanaged resource and pulling its configuration into Terraform state. Typically import support is added during initial resource implementation but in some cases this will need to be added later. Enhanced Region Support Most AWS resources are Regional \u2013 they are created and exist in a single AWS Region. By default Regional resources have a top-level <code>region</code> argument that allows the Region to be configured. Documentation Changes The provider documentation is displayed on the Terraform Registry and is sourced and refreshed from the provider repository during the release process."},{"location":"#4-write-tests","title":"4. Write Tests","text":"<p>We require all changes to be covered by acceptance tests and/or unit tests, depending on the situation.

The most common types of Resource Identity are ARN Identity and Parameterized Identity.</p> <ul> <li>If the resource type has a Parameterized Identity with multiple attributes,   it will need an Import ID Handler as described in the Resource Identity Reference.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Add testing annotations as appropriate for the resource type.

Data is either converted from a planned new Terraform State into making a remote system request, referred to as \"Expanding\", or a remote system response is converted into an applied new Terraform State, referred to as \"Flattening\". The semantics of how the data of the planned new Terraform State is surfaced to the resource implementation is determined by where a resource is in its lifecycle and is mainly handled by Terraform CLI. This concept can be explored further in the Terraform Resource Instance Change Lifecycle documentation, with the caveat that some additional behaviors occur within the Terraform Plugin SDK as well (if the Terraform Plugin uses that implementation detail).</p> <p>As a generic walkthrough, the following data handling occurs when creating a Terraform Resource:</p> <ul> <li>An operator creates a Terraform configuration with a new resource defined and runs <code>terraform apply</code></li> <li>Terraform CLI merges an empty prior state for the resource, along with the given configuration state, to create a planned new state for the resource</li> <li>Terraform CLI sends a Terraform Plugin Protocol request to create the new resource with its planned new state data</li> <li>If the Terraform Plugin is using a higher-level library, such as the Terraform Plugin Framework, that library receives the request and translates the Terraform Plugin Protocol data types into the expected library types</li> <li>Terraform Plugin invokes the resource creation function with the planned new state data<ul> <li>The planned new state data is converted into a remote system request (e.g., API creation request) that is invoked</li> <li>The remote system response is received and the data is converted into an applied new state</li> </ul> </li> <li>If the Terraform Plugin is using a higher-level library, such as the Terraform Plugin Framework, that library translates the library types back into Terraform Plugin Protocol data types</li> <li>Terraform Plugin responds to Terraform Plugin Protocol request with the new state data</li> <li>Terraform CLI verifies and stores the new state</li> </ul> <p>The lines in bold above are the focus of this page.</p>"},{"location":"data-handling-and-conversion/#implicit-state-passthrough","title":"Implicit State Passthrough","text":"<p>An important behavior to note with Terraform State handling is if the value of a particular root attribute or block is not refreshed during plan or apply operations, then the prior Terraform State is implicitly deep copied to the new Terraform State for that attribute or block.</p> <p>Given a resource with a writeable root attribute named <code>not_set_attr</code> that never explicitly writes a value, the following happens:</p> <ul> <li>If the Terraform configuration contains <code>not_set_attr = \"anything\"</code> on resource creation, the Terraform State contains <code>not_set_attr</code> equal to <code>\"anything\"</code> after apply.</li> <li>If the Terraform configuration is updated to <code>not_set_attr = \"updated\"</code>, the Terraform State contains <code>not_set_attr</code> equal to <code>\"updated\"</code> after apply.</li> <li>If the attribute was meant to be associated with a remote system value, it will never update the Terraform State on plan or apply with the remote value.

Ensuring proper handling during the various Terraform operations such as difference planning and Terraform State storage can be a burden.</li> <li>Hashed values are generally unusable in downstream attribute references. If a value is hashed, it cannot be successfully used in another resource or provider configuration that expects the real value.</li> <li>Terraform plan differences are meant to be human-readable. If a value is hashed, operators will only see the relatively unhelpful hash differences <code>abc123 -&gt; def456</code> in plans.</li> </ul> <p>Any value hashing implementation will not be accepted.

Since Terraform Configurations have no control over the behavior, hiding values from the plan difference can incur a potentially undesirable user experience cost for operators.</p> <p>Given that and especially with the improvements in Terraform CLI 0.14, the Terraform AWS Provider maintainers guiding principles for determining whether an Attribute should be marked as <code>Sensitive</code> is if an Attribute value:</p> <ul> <li>Objectively will always contain a credential, password, or other secret material. Operators can have differing opinions on what constitutes secret material and the maintainers will make best-effort determinations, if necessary consulting with the HashiCorp Security team.</li> <li>If the Attribute is within a Block, all occurrences of the Attribute value will objectively contain secret material. Some APIs (and therefore the Terraform AWS Provider resources) implement generic \"setting\" and \"value\" structures which likely will contain a mixture of secret and non-secret material. These will generally not be accepted for marking as <code>Sensitive</code>.</li> </ul> <p>If you are unsatisfied with sensitive value handling, the maintainers can recommend ensuring there is a covering issue in the Terraform CLI and/or Terraform Plugin Framework projects explaining the use case.

Terraform's current configuration language does not natively support triggering resource updates or recreation across resources without a state value change.

Use <code>d.Get()</code> and <code>d.Set()</code> directly with individual attributes instead.</li> <li>Avoids ResourceData.GetOkExists(): Resource logic should avoid using <code>ResourceData.GetOkExists()</code> as its expected functionality is not guaranteed in all scenarios.</li> <li>Calls Read After Create and Update: Except where API eventual consistency prohibits immediate reading of resources or updated attributes,  resource <code>Create</code> and <code>Update</code> functions should return the resource <code>Read</code> function.</li> <li>Implements Immediate Resource ID Set During Create: Immediately after calling the API creation function, the resource ID should be set with <code>d.SetId()</code> before other API operations or returning the <code>Read</code> function.</li> <li>Implements Attribute Refreshes During Read: All attributes available in the API should have <code>d.Set()</code> called their values in the Terraform state during the <code>Read</code> function.</li> <li>Performs Error Checks with Non-Primitive Attribute Refreshes: When using <code>d.Set()</code> with non-primitive types (<code>schema.TypeList</code>, <code>schema.TypeSet</code>, or <code>schema.TypeMap</code>), perform error checking to prevent issues where the code is not properly able to refresh the Terraform state.</li> <li>Implements Import Acceptance Testing and Documentation: Support for resource import (<code>Importer</code> in resource schema) must include <code>ImportState</code> acceptance testing (see also the Acceptance Testing Guidelines) and <code>## Import</code> section in resource documentation.</li> <li>Implements Customizable Timeouts Documentation: Support for customizable timeouts (<code>Timeouts</code> in resource schema) must include <code>## Timeouts</code> section in resource documentation.</li> <li>Implements State Migration When Adding New Virtual Attribute: For new \"virtual\" attributes (those only in Terraform and not in the API), the schema should implement State Migration to prevent differences for existing configurations that upgrade.</li> <li>Uses AWS Go SDK Constants: Many AWS services provide string constants for value enumerations, error codes, and status types. See also the \"Constants\" sections under each of the service packages in the AWS Go SDK documentation.</li> <li>Uses AWS Go SDK Pointer Conversion Functions: Many APIs return pointer types and these functions return the zero value for the type if the pointer is <code>nil</code>. This prevents potential panics from unchecked <code>*</code> pointer dereferences and can eliminate boilerplate <code>nil</code> checking in many cases. See also the <code>aws</code> package in the AWS Go SDK documentation.</li> <li>Uses AWS Go SDK Types: Use available SDK structs instead of implementing custom types with indirection.</li> <li>Uses Existing Validation Functions: Schema definitions including <code>ValidateFunc</code> for attribute validation should use available Terraform <code>helper/validation</code> package functions. <code>All()</code>/<code>Any()</code> can be used for combining multiple validation function behaviors.</li> <li>Uses tfresource.TimedOut() with retry.Retry(): Resource logic implementing <code>retry.Retry()</code> should error check with <code>tfresource.TimedOut(err error)</code> and potentially unset the error before returning the error. For example:</li> </ul> <pre><code>var output *kms.CreateKeyOutput\nerr := retry.Retry(1*time.Minute, func() *retry.RetryError {\nvar err error\n\noutput, err = conn.CreateKey(input)\n\n/* ... */\n\nreturn nil\n})\n\nif tfresource.TimedOut(err) {\noutput, err = conn.CreateKey(input)\n}\n\nif err != nil {\nreturn fmt.Errorf(\"creating KMS External Key: %s\", err)\n}\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Uses id.UniqueId(): API fields for concurrency protection such as <code>CallerReference</code> and <code>IdempotencyToken</code> should use <code>id.UniqueId()</code>. The implementation includes a monotonic counter which is safer for concurrent operations than solutions such as <code>time.Now()</code>.</li> <li>Skips id Attribute: The <code>id</code> attribute is implicit for all Terraform resources and does not need to be defined in the schema.</li> </ul> <p>The below are style-based items that may be noted during review and are recommended for simplicity, consistency, and quality assurance:</p> <ul> <li>Implements arn Attribute: APIs that return an ARN should implement <code>arn</code> as an attribute. Alternatively, the ARN can be synthesized using the AWS Go SDK <code>arn.ARN</code> structure. For example:</li> </ul> <pre><code>// Direct Connect Virtual Interface ARN.\n// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-resources.\narn := arn.ARN{\nPartition: meta.(*conns.AWSClient).Partition,\nRegion:    meta.(*conns.AWSClient).Region,\nService:   \"directconnect\",\nAccountID: meta.(*conns.AWSClient).AccountID,\nResource:  fmt.Sprintf(\"dxvif/%s\", d.Id()),\n}.String()\nd.Set(\"arn\", arn)\n</code></pre> <p>When the <code>arn</code> attribute is synthesized this way, add the resource to the list of those affected by the provider's <code>skip_requesting_account_id</code> attribute.</p> <ul> <li>Implements Warning Logging With Resource State Removal: If a resource is removed outside of Terraform (e.g., via a different tool, API, or web UI), <code>d.SetId(\"\")</code> and <code>return nil</code> can be used in the resource <code>Read</code> function to trigger resource recreation. When this occurs, a warning log message should be printed beforehand: <code>log.Printf(\"[WARN] {SERVICE} {THING} (%s) not found, removing from state\", d.Id())</code></li> <li>Uses American English for Attribute Naming: For any ambiguity with attribute naming, prefer American English over British English. e.g., <code>color</code> without the British <code>u</code>.</li> <li>Skips Timestamp Attributes: Generally, creation and modification dates from the API should be omitted from the schema.</li> <li>Uses Paginated AWS Go SDK Functions When Iterating Over a Collection of Objects: When the API for listing a collection of objects provides a paginated function, use it instead of looping until the next page token is not set. For example, with the EC2 API, <code>DescribeInstancesPages</code> should be used instead of <code>DescribeInstances</code> when more than one result is expected.</li> <li>Adds Paginated Functions Missing from the AWS Go SDK to Internal Service Package: If the AWS Go SDK does not define a paginated equivalent for a function to list a collection of objects, it should be added to a per-service internal package using the <code>listpages</code> generator. A support case should also be opened with AWS to have the paginated functions added to the AWS Go SDK.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"regular-expressions/","title":"Regular Expressions","text":""},{"location":"regular-expressions/#using-regular-expressions","title":"Using Regular Expressions","text":"<p>Regular expressions are a powerful tool.

This is    responsible for configuring the resource under test, and any dependencies it    may have. For example, to test the <code>aws_cloudwatch_dashboard</code> resource, a valid configuration with the requisite fields is required. This results in a configuration which looks like this:</p> <pre><code>resource \"aws_cloudwatch_dashboard\" \"foobar\" {\ndashboard_name = \"terraform-test-dashboard-%[1]d\"\ndashboard_body = &lt;&lt;EOF\n  {\n    \"widgets\": [{\n      \"type\": \"text\",\n      \"x\": 0,\n      \"y\": 0,\n      \"width\": 6,\n      \"height\": 6,\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"markdown\": \"Hi there from Terraform: CloudWatch\"\n      }\n    }]\n  }\n  EOF\n}\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Assertions are run using the provider API. These use the provider API    directly rather than asserting against the resource state. For example, to    verify that the <code>aws_cloudwatch_dashboard</code> described above was created    successfully, a test function like this is used:</p> <pre><code>func testAccCheckDashboardExists(ctx context.Context, n string, dashboard *cloudwatch.GetDashboardOutput) resource.TestCheckFunc {\nreturn func(s *terraform.State) error {\nrs, ok := s.RootModule().Resources[n]\nif !ok {\nreturn fmt.Errorf(\"Not found: %s\", n)\n}\n\nconn := acctest.Provider.Meta().(*conns.AWSClient).CloudWatchConn(ctx)\nparams := cloudwatch.GetDashboardInput{\nDashboardName: aws.String(rs.Primary.ID),\n}\n\nresp, err := conn.GetDashboardWithContext(ctx, &amp;params)\nif err != nil {\nreturn err\n}\n\n*dashboard = *resp\n\nreturn nil\n}\n}\n</code></pre> </li> </ol> <p>Notice that the only information used from the Terraform state is the ID of    the resource. For computed properties, we instead assert that the value saved in the Terraform state was the    expected value if possible. The testing framework provides helper functions    for several common types of checks - for example:</p> <pre><code>resource.TestCheckResourceAttr(\"aws_cloudwatch_dashboard.foobar\", \"dashboard_name\", testAccDashboardName(rInt)),\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>The resources created by the test are destroyed. This step happens    automatically, and is the equivalent of calling <code>terraform destroy</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Assertions are made against the provider API to verify that the resources    have indeed been removed. If these checks fail, the test fails and reports    \"dangling resources\". The code to ensure that the <code>aws_cloudwatch_dashboard</code> shown    above has been destroyed looks like this:</p> <pre><code>func testAccCheckDashboardDestroy(ctx context.Context) resource.TestCheckFunc {\nreturn func(s *terraform.State) error {\nconn := acctest.Provider.Meta().(*conns.AWSClient).CloudWatchConn(ctx)\n\nfor _, rs := range s.RootModule().Resources {\nif rs.Type != \"aws_cloudwatch_dashboard\" {\ncontinue\n}\n\nparams := cloudwatch.GetDashboardInput{\nDashboardName: aws.String(rs.Primary.ID),\n}\n\n_, err := conn.GetDashboardWithContext(ctx, &amp;params)\nif err == nil {\nreturn fmt.Errorf(\"Dashboard still exists: %s\", rs.Primary.ID)\n}\nif !isDashboardNotFoundErr(err) {\nreturn err\n}\n}\n\nreturn nil\n}\n}\n</code></pre> </li> </ol> <p>These functions usually test only for the resource directly under test.</p>"},{"location":"running-and-writing-acceptance-tests/#resource-acceptance-testing","title":"Resource Acceptance Testing","text":"<p>Most resources that implement standard Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality should follow the pattern below.

Created: 2024-09-06 Author: @jar-b </p> <p>Within AWS there are several resource types which have direct relationships or dependencies on one another. These can be either \"one-to-one\", where a single entity is linked to another, or \"one-to-many\", where a single parent entity can be linked to multiple children. As the Terraform AWS provider has matured, the patterns for modeling these relationships have evolved, most notably in the \"one-to-many\" style relationships.</p> <p>This RFC will cover a brief history of \"one-to-many\" resource relationships and their representation in the Terraform AWS provider, followed by a proposal for enabling exclusive management of these relationships via a standalone resource. For an in-depth review of all relationship resources in the Terraform AWS provider, refer to the relationship resource design standards design decision.</p>"},{"location":"design-decisions/exclusive-relationship-management-resources/#background","title":"Background","text":"<p>During early development of the Terraform AWS provider, resources sometimes represented \"one-to-many\" relationships as arguments on the parent resource. For example, the <code>inline_policy</code> argument on the <code>aws_iam_role</code> resource allows inline policies to be created as part of the role resource lifecycle.</p> <pre><code>resource \"aws_iam_role\" \"example\" {\nname               = \"exampleRole\"\nassume_role_policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.instance_assume_role_policy.json\n\ninline_policy {\nname   = \"exampleInlinePolicy\"\npolicy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.inline_policy.json\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>While simplifying the syntax for practitioners, this approach introduces complexity within the provider implementation; a single resource now manages the lifecycle of several different remote resources. This can leave the resource in a partially provisioned state if creation of one of the child resources fails. One benefit to this design is that it enables the parent resource to retain \"exclusive\" control of the relationships. That is, if the parent resource includes a relationship with a child entity that is not explicitly configured, the provider can remove it.</p> <p>Due to the complexity of the design described above, the Terraform AWS provider has moved toward representing \"one-to-many\" relationships via standalone resources. These resources are typically added alongside the argument-based method to preserve backward compatibility. Continuing with the example above, inline policies can now be managed distinctly from the assigned role via the <code>aws_iam_role_policy</code> resource.</p> <pre><code>resource \"aws_iam_role\" \"example\" {\nname               = \"exampleRole\"\nassume_role_policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.instance_assume_role_policy.json\n}\n\nresource \"aws_iam_role_policy\" \"example\" {\nname = \"exampleInlinePolicy\"\nrole = aws_iam_role.test_role.id\n\npolicy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.inline_policy.json\n}\n</code></pre> <p>While this separates the lifecycle of distinct resource types to more closely align with the underlying AWS APIs, this approach alone does not provide a mechanism for exclusive management of all relationships to the parent. The absence of this benefit is often cited by the community as a reason not to move away from the argument-based definitions to standalone resources. The lack of parity has also prevented maintainers from formally deprecating and removing arguments on the parent resource for configuring relationships.</p>"},{"location":"design-decisions/exclusive-relationship-management-resources/#existing-resources","title":"Existing Resources","text":"<p>There is some precedent in the Terraform AWS provider for a resource which handles only exclusive relationship management in <code>aws_iam_policy_attachment</code>. However, the scope of responsibility in this resource (managing attachments to roles, users, and groups simultaneously), is broader than what this RFC proposes, and cannot be replicated widely due to the unique nature of customer managed IAM policies which can be associated with multiple distinct parent resource types.</p>"},{"location":"design-decisions/exclusive-relationship-management-resources/#proposal","title":"Proposal","text":"<p>To provide practitioners with a consistent and maintainable mechanism for exclusive management of \"one-to-many\" relationships, the Terraform AWS provider will introduce a new pattern for developing \"exclusive relationship management\" resources. Resources with this function will end in the suffix <code>_exclusive</code>, with the purpose of reconciling the relationships present in AWS against what is configured in Terraform, adding and removing relationships as necessary.</p> <p>In general, exclusive relationship management resources should have the following characteristics:</p> <ol> <li>A required argument (typically <code>TypeString</code>) storing the parent resource identifier.</li> <li>A required argument (typically <code>TypeSet</code> with <code>TypeString</code> elements) storing identifiers of all child resources. An empty set should remove all relationships.</li> <li>The ability to read the current state of relationships in AWS and add or remove them as necessary.</li> <li>The ability to \"inherit\" exclusive ownership of existing relationship definitions without destructive action. Adding this resource to a configuration should not result in a destroy/re-create relationship workflow.</li> </ol> <p>As an example, the implementation for inline IAM policies would be named <code>aws_iam_role_policies_exclusive</code>, and used as follows:</p> <pre><code>resource \"aws_iam_role\" \"example\" {\nname               = \"exampleRole\"\nassume_role_policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.instance_assume_role_policy.json\n}\n\nresource \"aws_iam_role_policy\" \"example\" {\nname = \"exampleInlinePolicy\"\nrole = aws_iam_role.example.id\n\npolicy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.inline_policy.json\n}\n\n# This resource ensures that only `exampleInlinePolicy` is assigned\n# to this role.

The <code>_exclusive</code> resource will detect any additional inline policies assigned to the role during <code>plan</code> operations and remove them during <code>apply</code>. This behavior provides parity with the <code>inline_policy</code> argument on the <code>aws_iam_role</code> resource, allowing maintainers to formally deprecate this argument and suggest practitioners migrate to the standalone inline policy resource, optionally including an <code>_exclusive</code> resource when exclusive management of assignments is desired.</p>"},{"location":"design-decisions/exclusive-relationship-management-resources/#potential-resources","title":"Potential Resources","text":"<p>In addition to the IAM inline policy example used throughout this document, there are several other resources with \"one-to-many\" relationships that could benefit from exclusive management of relationships.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Due to the popularity of the resources in this section, argument deprecations are likely to be \"soft\" deprecations where removal will not happen for several major releases, or until tooling is available to limit the amount of manual changes required to migrate to the preferred pattern.

Created: 2024-05-24 Author: @jar-b </p> <p>Historically all resources in the Terraform AWS provider have included a read-only <code>id</code> attribute, as Terraform Plugin SDK V2 and its associated acceptance testing library requires it. In most cases, this attribute corresponds to a unique identifier generated by AWS during resource creation. However, for some resources the identifier is a value provided by the user and the resulting <code>id</code> attribute inherently duplicates the value of some other required argument.</p> <p>With the general availability of Terraform Plugin Framework, the separation of the provider testing functionality into its own standalone library (<code>terraform-plugin-testing</code>), and some corresponding enhancements made to this library, resources are no longer required to have an <code>id</code> attribute. This leaves an opportunity for provider developers to define a standard for when to use an <code>id</code> attribute. Broadly, the two options are:</p> <ul> <li>Continue to require an <code>id</code> attribute in all resources for consistency.  </li> <li>Omit the <code>id</code> attribute when it is redundant with some other required argument(s).</li> </ul> <p>This RFC will propose a standard for the Terraform AWS provider. A secondary goal is to gain feedback from other HashiCorp-owned provider teams to determine if a common standard can be shared across the provider ecosystem.</p>"},{"location":"design-decisions/standardize-use-of-the-id-attribute/#background","title":"Background","text":"<p>Prior to general availability of the Terraform Plugin Framework, all providers were built with the Terraform Plugin SDK. As the Terraform Plugin SDK was developed with pre-v1.0 versions of Terraform, an internal core implementation detail requiring the presence of an <code>id</code> attribute was incorporated into the library design. This requirement was accordingly passed along to provider developers in the form of an implicit requirement that all resources have an <code>id</code> attribute.</p> <p>This convention is most noticeable in the method for setting <code>id</code> attributes (<code>d.SetId(\u201cvalue\u201d)</code>, versus <code>d.Set(\u201cfield\u201d, \u201cvalue\u201d)</code>), the special syntax for removing objects from state during a read operation when deleted outside of Terraform (<code>d.SetId(\u201c\u201d)</code>), and the acceptance testing helpers for <code>import</code>, which rely on a populated <code>id</code> attribute to complete the import command and verify the results.</p> <p>The corresponding method for removing Terraform Plugin Framework-based resources from state during read (<code>State.RemoveResource</code>) includes no mention of an ID. In version <code>1.5.0</code> of <code>terraform-plugin-testing</code>, additional fields were added to the <code>TestStep</code> struct to enable testing imports for resources that do not implement an <code>id</code> attribute. With these advancements, providers using Terraform Plugin Framework, either exclusively or via a muxed provider configuration, and <code>terraform-plugin-testing</code> in place of the legacy testing packages embedded in Terraform Plugin SDK V2 are no longer bound to the requirement of including an <code>id</code> attribute in every resource.</p> <p>From a Terraform core perspective, releases after 0.12 no longer treat <code>id</code> as a special attribute. Terraform 0.11 and earlier implicitly required it. Due to the linkage between Terraform 0.12 and protocol version 5, and the fact that supported provider SDKs today only speak protocol version 5 (and 6), the primary Hashicorp-owned providers, like <code>hashicorp/aws</code>, inherently only support Terraform 0.12 and later. Therefore it is safe to remove the <code>id</code> attribute since there is no concern for a Terraform version that requires it.</p>"},{"location":"design-decisions/standardize-use-of-the-id-attribute/#id-attributes-in-the-aws-provider","title":"<code>id</code> Attributes in the AWS Provider","text":"<p>In the AWS provider, the <code>id</code> attribute most commonly corresponds to an identifier generated by AWS during creation of the resource. The Create API typically returns this value as a field named <code>Id</code> or, in some cases, <code>Id</code> with a prefixed with a resource name (eg. <code>InstanceId</code>). When a resource can be referenced by a unique, remotely generated identifier, storing this value in a computed <code>id</code> is a straightforward choice and the meaning of the attribute is easily understood by the practitioner.</p> <p>However, there are cases where AWS does not generate a unique identifier during resource creation, and instead one or more of the arguments supplied to the Create API functions as the identifier. For single value identifiers this is commonly a field like <code>name</code>. For \u201crelationship\u201d resources (ie. resources creating a link between two other resources, such as an IAM policy attachment), the unique identifier may be a \u201cmulti-part key\u201d made up of identifiers from both resources being linked. Historically, multi-part keys have not used a consistent delimiter, further complicating the user experience for practitioners.</p> <p>In these situations, the AWS provider copied the identifying value (or a delimited string of values for multi-part keys) to the <code>id</code> attribute.
