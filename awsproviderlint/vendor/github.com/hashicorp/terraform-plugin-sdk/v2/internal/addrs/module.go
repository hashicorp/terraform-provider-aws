package addrs

// Module is an address for a module call within configuration. This is
// the static counterpart of ModuleInstance, representing a traversal through
// the static module call tree in configuration and does not take into account
// the potentially-multiple instances of a module that might be created by
// "count" and "for_each" arguments within those calls.
//
// This type should be used only in very specialized cases when working with
// the static module call tree. Type ModuleInstance is appropriate in more cases.
//
// Although Module is a slice, it should be treated as immutable after creation.
