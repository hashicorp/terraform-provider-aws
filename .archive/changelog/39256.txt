```release-note:note
provider: Downgrades to Go `1.22.6`. A small number of users have reported failed or hanging network connections using the version of the Terraform AWS provider which was first built with Go `1.23.0` (`v5.65.0`). At this point, maintainers have been unable to reproduce failures, but enough distinct users have reported issues that we are going to attempt downgrading to Go `1.22.6` for the next provider release. We will continue to coordinate with users and AWS in an attempt to identify the root cause, using this upcoming release with a reverted Go build version as a data point.
