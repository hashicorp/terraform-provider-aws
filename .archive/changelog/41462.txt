```release-note:note
resource/aws_service_thing: A warning diagnostic has been added for configurations where `rule.exipration.expired_object_delete_marker` is set with either `rule.exipration.date` or `rule.exipration.days`. While historically the provider allowed this invalid configuration, the migration of this resource to the Terraform Plugin Framework in `v5.86.0` resulted in this misconfiguration surfacing as a hard `inconsistent result after apply` error. This diagnostic aims to direct users how to resolve the issue at plan time. See [this issue comment](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/41277#issuecomment-2654728812) for additional context.
