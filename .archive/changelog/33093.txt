data-source/aws_iam_policy_document: Fix inconsistent handling of `condition` blocks with duplicated `test` and `variable` arguments
```

```release-note:note
data-source/aws_iam_policy_document: In some cases, `statement.*.condition` blocks with the same `test` and `variable` arguments were incorrectly handled by the provider. Since this results in unexpected IAM Policies being submitted to AWS, we have updated the logic to merge `values` lists in this case. This may cause existing IAM Policy documents to report a difference. However, those policies are likely not what was originally intended.
```
