```release-note:note
provider: This release contains an upstream AWS SDK for Go v2 [change](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/issues/2807) to DynamoDB service endpoints. The Terraform AWS Provider will now connect to a DynamoDB endpoint in the format [`(account-id).ddb.(region).amazonaws.com`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/feature-account-endpoints.html) instead of `dynamodb.(region).amazonaws.com`. If your network configuration blocks outgoing traffic to DynamoDB based on DNS names or endpoint URLs, you must adjust your configuration, because the service's DNS name will change. You may instead disable account-based endpoints for DynamoDB by setting `account_id_endpoint_mode = disabled` in a [shared config file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/settings-reference.html#ConfigFileSettings) or setting the `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_ENDPOINT_MODE` [environment variable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/settings-reference.html#EVarSettings) to `disabled`
```
