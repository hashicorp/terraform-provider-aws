```release-note:note
data-source/aws_redshift_service_account: The `aws_redshift_service_account` data source has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. AWS documentation [states that](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/db-auditing.html#db-auditing-bucket-permissions) a [service principal name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html#principal-services) should be used instead of an AWS account ID in any relevant IAM policy
```
