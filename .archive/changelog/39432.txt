provider: Updates to Go `1.23.1`. The issue with AWS Network Firewall dropping TLS handshake `ClientHello` messages after the **v5.65.0** upgrade to Go `1.23.0`, temporarily resolved by the **v5.67.0** downgrade to Go `1.22.7`, has been addressed by removing the `X25519Kyber768Draft00` key exchange mechanism from the HTTP client used to make AWS API calls
