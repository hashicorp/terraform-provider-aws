```release-note:note
resource/aws_lexv2models_slot_type: Within the `composite_slot_type_setting` block, the `subslots` argument has been renamed `sub_slots`. See the [linked pull request](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/pull/39353) for additional justification on this change. The previous misnaming effectively made this argument unusable, therefore a breaking change in a minor version was deemed acceptable.
