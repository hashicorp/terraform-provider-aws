```release-note:note
provider: This release includes an update to the AWS SDK for Go v2 with breaking type changes to several services: `finspace`, `kafka`, `medialive`, `rds`, `s3control`, `timestreamwrite`, and `xray`. These changes primarily affect how arguments with default values are serialized for outbound requests, changing scalar types to pointers. See [this AWS SDK for Go V2 issue](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/issues/2162) for additional context. The corresponding provider changes should make this breakfix transparent to users, but as with any breaking change there is the potential for missed edge cases. If errors are observed in the impacted resources, please link to this dependency update pull request in the bug report.
