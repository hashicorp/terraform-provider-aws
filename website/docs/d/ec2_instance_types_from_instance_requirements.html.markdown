  ```

- `accelerator_total_memory_mib` - (Optional) Block describing the minimum and maximum total memory of the accelerators. Default is no minimum or maximum.

    - `min` - (Optional) Minimum.
    - `max` - (Optional) Maximum.

- `accelerator_types` - (Optional) List of accelerator types. Default is any accelerator type.

  ```
  Valid types:
    * fpga
    * gpu
    * inference
  ```

- `allowed_instance_types` - (Optional) List of instance types to apply your specified attributes against. All other instance types are ignored, even if they match your specified attributes. You can use strings with one or more wild cards, represented by an asterisk (\*), to allow an instance type, size, or generation. The following are examples: `m5.8xlarge`, `c5*.*`, `m5a.*`, `r*`, `*3*`. For example, if you specify `c5*`, you are allowing the entire C5 instance family, which includes all C5a and C5n instance types. If you specify `m5a.*`, you are allowing all the M5a instance types, but not the M5n instance types. Maximum of 400 entries in the list; each entry is limited to 30 characters. Default is all instance types.

  ~> **NOTE:** If you specify `allowed_instance_types`, you can't specify `excluded_instance_types`.

- `bare_metal` - (Optional) Indicate whether bare metal instace types should be `included`, `excluded`, or `required`. Default is `excluded`.
- `baseline_ebs_bandwidth_mbps` - (Optional) Block describing the minimum and maximum baseline EBS bandwidth, in Mbps. Default is no minimum or maximum.
    - `min` - (Optional) Minimum.
    - `max` - (Optional) Maximum.
- `baseline_performance_factors` - (Optional) Block describing the baseline performance to consider, using an instance family as a reference. The instance family establishes the lowest acceptable level of performance. Amazon EC2 uses this baseline to guide instance type selection, but there is no guarantee that the selected instance types will always exceed the baseline for every application. Currently, this parameter only supports CPU performance as a baseline performance factor.
    - `cpu` - (Optional) The CPU performance to consider, using an instance family as the baseline reference.
        - `reference` - (Optional) Specify an instance family to use as the baseline reference for CPU performance. All instance types that match your specified attributes will be compared against the CPU performance of the referenced instance family, regardless of CPU manufacturer or architecture differences.
            - `instance_family` - (Optional) The instance family to use as a baseline reference.
- `burstable_performance` - (Optional) Indicate whether burstable performance instance types should be `included`, `excluded`, or `required`. Default is `excluded`.
- `cpu_manufacturers` (Optional) List of CPU manufacturer names. Default is any manufacturer.

  ~> **NOTE:** Don't confuse the CPU hardware manufacturer with the CPU hardware architecture. Instances will be launched with a compatible CPU architecture based on the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that you specify in your launch template.

  ```
  Valid names:
    * amazon-web-services
    * amd
    * intel
  ```

- `excluded_instance_types` - (Optional) List of instance types to exclude. You can use strings with one or more wild cards, represented by an asterisk (\*), to exclude an instance type, size, or generation. The following are examples: `m5.8xlarge`, `c5*.*`, `m5a.*`, `r*`, `*3*`. For example, if you specify `c5*`, you are excluding the entire C5 instance family, which includes all C5a and C5n instance types. If you specify `m5a.*`, you are excluding all the M5a instance types, but not the M5n instance types. Maximum of 400 entries in the list; each entry is limited to 30 characters. Default is no excluded instance types.

  ~> **NOTE:** If you specify `excluded_instance_types`, you can't specify `allowed_instance_types`.

- `instance_generations` - (Optional) List of instance generation names. Default is any generation.

  ```
  Valid names:
    * current  - Recommended for best performance.
    * previous - For existing applications optimized for older instance types.
  ```

- `local_storage` - (Optional) Indicate whether instance types with local storage volumes are `included`, `excluded`, or `required`. Default is `included`.
- `local_storage_types` - (Optional) List of local storage type names. Default any storage type.

    - `min` - (Optional) Minimum.
    - `max` - (Optional) Maximum.
- `on_demand_max_price_percentage_over_lowest_price` - (Optional) Price protection threshold for On-Demand Instances. This is the maximum you’ll pay for an On-Demand Instance, expressed as a percentage higher than the cheapest M, C, or R instance type with your specified attributes. When Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects instance types with your attributes, we will exclude instance types whose price is higher than your threshold. The parameter accepts an integer, which Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling interprets as a percentage. To turn off price protection, specify a high value, such as 999999. Default is 20.

  If you set DesiredCapacityType to vcpu or memory-mib, the price protection threshold is applied based on the per vCPU or per memory price instead of the per instance price.

- `require_hibernate_support` - (Optional) Indicate whether instance types must support On-Demand Instance Hibernation, either `true` or `false`. Default is `false`.
- `spot_max_price_percentage_over_lowest_price` - (Optional) Price protection threshold for Spot Instances. This is the maximum you’ll pay for a Spot Instance, expressed as a percentage higher than the cheapest M, C, or R instance type with your specified attributes. When Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects instance types with your attributes, we will exclude instance types whose price is higher than your threshold. The parameter accepts an integer, which Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling interprets as a percentage. To turn off price protection, specify a high value, such as 999999. Default is 100.

  If you set DesiredCapacityType to vcpu or memory-mib, the price protection threshold is applied based on the per vCPU or per memory price instead of the per instance price.

- `total_local_storage_gb` - (Optional) Block describing the minimum and maximum total local storage (GB). Default is no minimum or maximum.
    - `min` - (Optional) Minimum. May be a decimal number, e.g. `0.5`.
