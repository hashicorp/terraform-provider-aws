# Data Source: aws_secretsmanager_secret_version

Retrieve information about a Secrets Manager secret version, including its secret value. To retrieve secret metadata, see the [`aws_secretsmanager_secret` data source](/docs/providers/aws/d/secretsmanager_secret.html).

## Example Usage

### Retrieve Current Secret Version

By default, this data sources retrieves information based on the `AWSCURRENT` staging label.

```terraform
data "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "secret-version" {
  secret_id = data.aws_secretsmanager_secret.example.id
}
```

### Retrieve Specific Secret Version

```terraform
data "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "by-version-stage" {
  secret_id     = data.aws_secretsmanager_secret.example.id
  version_stage = "example"
}
```

### Handling Key-Value Secret Strings in JSON

Reading key-value pairs from JSON back into a native Terraform map can be accomplished in Terraform 0.12 and later with the [`jsondecode()` function](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions/jsondecode.html):

```terraform
output "example" {
  value = jsondecode(data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.example.secret_string)["key1"]
}
```
