# Data Source: aws_licensemanager_received_licenses

This resource can be used to get a set of license ARNs matching a filter.

## Example Usage

The following shows getting all license ARNs issued from the AWS marketplace. Providing no filter, would provide all license ARNs for the entire account.

```terraform
data "aws_licensemanager_received_licenses" "test" {
  filter {
    name = "IssuerName"
    values = [
      "AWS/Marketplace"
    ]
  }
}
```
