# Data Source: aws_msk_cluster

Get information on an Amazon MSK Cluster.

```hcl
data "aws_msk_cluster" "example" {
  cluster_name = "example"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `cluster_name` - (Required) Name of the cluster.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the MSK cluster.
* `bootstrap_brokers` - A comma separated list of one or more hostname:port pairs of Kafka brokers suitable to boostrap connectivity to the Kafka cluster. Only contains value if `client_broker` encryption in transit is set to `PLAINTEXT` or `TLS_PLAINTEXT`. The returned values are sorted alphbetically. The AWS API may not return all endpoints, so this value is not guaranteed to be stable across applies.
* `bootstrap_brokers_sasl_scram` - A comma separated list of one or more DNS names (or IPs) and TLS port pairs kafka brokers suitable to boostrap connectivity using SASL/SCRAM to the kafka cluster. Only contains value if `client_broker` encryption in transit is set to `TLS_PLAINTEXT` or `TLS` and `client_authentication` is set to `sasl`. The returned values are sorted alphbetically. The AWS API may not return all endpoints, so this value is not guaranteed to be stable across applies.
* `bootstrap_brokers_tls` - A comma separated list of one or more DNS names (or IPs) and TLS port pairs kafka brokers suitable to boostrap connectivity to the kafka cluster. Only contains value if `client_broker` encryption in transit is set to `TLS_PLAINTEXT` or `TLS`. The returned values are sorted alphbetically. The AWS API may not return all endpoints, so this value is not guaranteed to be stable across applies.
* `kafka_version` - Apache Kafka version.
* `number_of_broker_nodes` - Number of broker nodes in the cluster.
* `tags` - Map of key-value pairs assigned to the cluster.
* `zookeeper_connect_string` - A comma separated list of one or more hostname:port pairs to use to connect to the Apache Zookeeper cluster. The returned values are sorted alphbetically. The AWS API may not return all endpoints, so this value is not guaranteed to be stable across applies.
