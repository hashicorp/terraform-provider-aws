# Data Source: aws_msk_cluster

Get information on an Amazon MSK Cluster.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "aws_msk_cluster" "example" {
  cluster_name = "example"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `cluster_name` - (Required) Name of the cluster.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the MSK cluster.
* `bootstrap_brokers` - Comma separated list of one or more hostname:port pairs of kafka brokers suitable to bootstrap connectivity to the kafka cluster. Contains a value if `encryption_info.0.encryption_in_transit.0.client_broker` is set to `PLAINTEXT` or `TLS_PLAINTEXT`. The resource sorts values alphabetically. AWS may not always return all endpoints so this value is not guaranteed to be stable across applies.
* `bootstrap_brokers_public_sasl_iam` - One or more DNS names (or IP addresses) and SASL IAM port pairs. For example, `b-1-public.exampleClusterName.abcde.c2.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:9198,b-2-public.exampleClusterName.abcde.c2.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:9198,b-3-public.exampleClusterName.abcde.c2.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:9198`. This attribute will have a value if `encryption_info.0.encryption_in_transit.0.client_broker` is set to `TLS_PLAINTEXT` or `TLS` and `client_authentication.0.sasl.0.iam` is set to `true` and `broker_node_group_info.0.connectivity_info.0.public_access.0.type` is set to `SERVICE_PROVIDED_EIPS` and the cluster fulfill all other requirements for public access. The resource sorts the list alphabetically. AWS may not always return all endpoints so the values may not be stable across applies.
* `bootstrap_brokers_public_sasl_scram` - One or more DNS names (or IP addresses) and SASL SCRAM port pairs. For example, `b-1-public.exampleClusterName.abcde.c2.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:9196,b-2-public.exampleClusterName.abcde.c2.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:9196,b-3-public.exampleClusterName.abcde.c2.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:9196`. This attribute will have a value if `encryption_info.0.encryption_in_transit.0.client_broker` is set to `TLS_PLAINTEXT` or `TLS` and `client_authentication.0.sasl.0.scram` is set to `true` and `broker_node_group_info.0.connectivity_info.0.public_access.0.type` is set to `SERVICE_PROVIDED_EIPS` and the cluster fulfill all other requirements for public access. The resource sorts the list alphabetically. AWS may not always return all endpoints so the values may not be stable across applies.
* `bootstrap_brokers_public_tls` - One or more DNS names (or IP addresses) and TLS port pairs. For example, `b-1-public.exampleClusterName.abcde.c2.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:9194,b-2-public.exampleClusterName.abcde.c2.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:9194,b-3-public.exampleClusterName.abcde.c2.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:9194`. This attribute will have a value if `encryption_info.0.encryption_in_transit.0.client_broker` is set to `TLS_PLAINTEXT` or `TLS` and `broker_node_group_info.0.connectivity_info.0.public_access.0.type` is set to `SERVICE_PROVIDED_EIPS` and the cluster fulfill all other requirements for public access. The resource sorts the list alphabetically. AWS may not always return all endpoints so the values may not be stable across applies.
* `bootstrap_brokers_sasl_iam` - One or more DNS names (or IP addresses) and SASL IAM port pairs. For example, `b-1.exampleClusterName.abcde.c2.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:9098,b-2.exampleClusterName.abcde.c2.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:9098,b-3.exampleClusterName.abcde.c2.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:9098`. This attribute will have a value if `encryption_info.0.encryption_in_transit.0.client_broker` is set to `TLS_PLAINTEXT` or `TLS` and `client_authentication.0.sasl.0.iam` is set to `true`. The resource sorts the list alphabetically. AWS may not always return all endpoints so the values may not be stable across applies.
* `bootstrap_brokers_sasl_scram` - One or more DNS names (or IP addresses) and SASL SCRAM port pairs. For example, `b-1.exampleClusterName.abcde.c2.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:9096,b-2.exampleClusterName.abcde.c2.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:9096,b-3.exampleClusterName.abcde.c2.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:9096`. This attribute will have a value if `encryption_info.0.encryption_in_transit.0.client_broker` is set to `TLS_PLAINTEXT` or `TLS` and `client_authentication.0.sasl.0.scram` is set to `true`. The resource sorts the list alphabetically. AWS may not always return all endpoints so the values may not be stable across applies.
* `bootstrap_brokers_tls` - One or more DNS names (or IP addresses) and TLS port pairs. For example, `b-1.exampleClusterName.abcde.c2.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:9094,b-2.exampleClusterName.abcde.c2.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:9094,b-3.exampleClusterName.abcde.c2.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:9094`. This attribute will have a value if `encryption_info.0.encryption_in_transit.0.client_broker` is set to `TLS_PLAINTEXT` or `TLS`. The resource sorts the list alphabetically. AWS may not always return all endpoints so the values may not be stable across applies.
* `kafka_version` - Apache Kafka version.
* `number_of_broker_nodes` - Number of broker nodes in the cluster.
* `tags` - Map of key-value pairs assigned to the cluster.
* `zookeeper_connect_string` - A comma separated list of one or more hostname:port pairs to use to connect to the Apache Zookeeper cluster. The returned values are sorted alphbetically. The AWS API may not return all endpoints, so this value is not guaranteed to be stable across applies.
* `zookeeper_connect_string_tls` - A comma separated list of one or more hostname:port pairs to use to connect to the Apache Zookeeper cluster via TLS. The returned values are sorted alphabetically. The AWS API may not return all endpoints, so this value is not guaranteed to be stable across applies.
