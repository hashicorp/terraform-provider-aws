# Data Source: aws_route53_resolver_rules

`aws_route53_resolver_rules` provides details about a set of Route53 Resolver rules.

## Example Usage

### Retrieving the default resolver rule

```terraform
data "aws_route53_resolver_rules" "example" {
  owner_id     = "Route 53 Resolver"
  rule_type    = "RECURSIVE"
  share_status = "NOT_SHARED"
}
```

### Retrieving forward rules shared with me

```terraform
data "aws_route53_resolver_rules" "example" {
  rule_type    = "FORWARD"
  share_status = "SHARED_WITH_ME"
}
```

### Retrieving rules by name regex

Resolver rules whose name contains `abc`.

```terraform
data "aws_route53_resolver_rules" "example" {
  name_regex = ".*abc.*"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The arguments of this data source act as filters for querying the available resolver rules in the current region.

* `name_regex` - (Optional) A regex string to filter resolver rule names.
  The filtering is done locally, so could have a performance impact if the result is large.
  This argument should be used along with other arguments to limit the number of results returned.
* `owner_id` (Optional) When the desired resolver rules are shared with another AWS account, the account ID of the account that the rules are shared with.
* `resolver_endpoint_id` (Optional) The ID of the outbound resolver endpoint for the desired resolver rules.
* `rule_type` (Optional) The rule type of the desired resolver rules. Valid values are `FORWARD`, `SYSTEM` and `RECURSIVE`.
* `share_status` (Optional) Whether the desired resolver rules are shared and, if so, whether the current account is sharing the rules with another account, or another account is sharing the rules with the current account. Valid values are `NOT_SHARED`, `SHARED_BY_ME` or `SHARED_WITH_ME`

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - AWS Region.
* `resolver_rule_ids` - The IDs of the matched resolver rules.
