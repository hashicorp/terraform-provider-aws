  Get information on an Amazon EC2 Instance.

# Data Source: aws_instance

Use this data source to get the ID of an Amazon EC2 Instance for use in other
resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "aws_instance" "foo" {
  instance_id = "i-instanceid"

  filter {
    name   = "image-id"
    values = ["ami-xxxxxxxx"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "tag:Name"
    values = ["instance-name-tag"]
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `instance_id` - (Optional) Specify the exact Instance ID with which to populate the data source.

* `instance_tags` - (Optional) A map of tags, each pair of which must
exactly match a pair on the desired Instance.

* `filter` - (Optional) One or more name/value pairs to use as filters. There are
several valid keys, for a full reference, check out
[describe-instances in the AWS CLI reference][1].

* `get_password_data` - (Optional) If true, wait for password data to become available and retrieve it. Useful for getting the administrator password for instances running Microsoft Windows. The password data is exported to the `password_data` attribute. See [GetPasswordData](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_GetPasswordData.html) for more information.

* `get_user_data` - (Optional) Retrieve Base64 encoded User Data contents into the `user_data_base64` attribute. A SHA-1 hash of the User Data contents will always be present in the `user_data` attribute. Defaults to `false`.

~> **NOTE:** At least one of `filter`, `instance_tags`, or `instance_id` must be specified.

~> **NOTE:** If anything other than a single match is returned by the search,
Terraform will fail. Ensure that your search is specific enough to return
a single Instance ID only.

## Attributes Reference

`id` is set to the ID of the found Instance. In addition, the following attributes

    * `virtual_name` - The virtual device name.
* `iam_instance_profile` - The name of the instance profile associated with the Instance.
* `ipv6_addresses` - The IPv6 addresses associated to the Instance, if applicable. **NOTE**: Unlike the IPv4 address, this doesn't change if you attach an EIP to the instance.
* `instance_state` - The state of the instance. One of: `pending`, `running`, `shutting-down`, `terminated`, `stopping`, `stopped`. See [Instance Lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html) for more information.
