# Data Source: aws_docdb_engine_version

Information about a DocumentDB engine version.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "aws_docdb_engine_version" "test" {
  version = "3.6.0"
}
```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `region` - (Optional) Region where this resource will be [managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints).

* `parameter_group_family` - (Optional) Name of a specific DB parameter group family. An example parameter group family is `docdb3.6`.

If no preferred matches are found and the original search returned more than one result, an error is returned. If both the `version` and `preferred_versions` arguments are not configured, the data source will return the default version for the engine.
* `version` - (Optional) Version of the DB engine. For example, `3.6.0`. If `version` and `preferred_versions` are not set, the data source will provide information for the AWS-defined default version. If both the `version` and `preferred_versions` arguments are not configured, the data source will return the default version for the engine.
