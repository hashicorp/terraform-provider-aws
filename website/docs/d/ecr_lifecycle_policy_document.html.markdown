# Data Source: aws_ecr_lifecycle_policy_document

Generates an ECR lifecycle policy document in JSON format. Can be used with resources such as the [`aws_ecr_lifecycle_policy` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/ecr_lifecycle_policy.html).

-> For more information about building AWS ECR lifecycle policy documents, see the [AWS ECR Lifecycle Policy Document Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/LifecyclePolicies.html).

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "aws_ecr_lifecycle_policy_document" "example" {
  rule {
    priority    = 1
    description = "This is a test."

    selection {
      tag_status      = "tagged"
      tag_prefix_list = ["prod"]
      count_type      = "imageCountMoreThan"
      count_number    = 100
    }
  }
}

resource "aws_ecr_lifecycle_policy" "example" {
  repository = aws_ecr_repository.example.name

  policy = data.aws_ecr_lifecycle_policy_document.example.json
}
```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

Each document configuration may have one or more `rule` blocks, which each accept the following arguments:

* `action` (Optional) - Specifies the action to take.
    * `type` (Required) - Specify an action type. The supported values are `expire` (to delete images) and `transition` (to move images to archive storage).
    * `target_storage_class` (Required if `type` is `transition`) - The storage class you want the lifecycle policy to transition the image to. `archive` is the only supported value.
* `description` (Optional) - Describes the purpose of a rule within a lifecycle policy.
* `priority` (Required) - Sets the order in which rules are evaluated, lowest to highest. When you add rules to a lifecycle policy, you must give them each a unique value for `priority`. Values do not need to be sequential across rules in a policy. A rule with a `tag_status` value of `any` must have the highest value for `priority` and be evaluated last.
* `selection` (Required) -  Collects parameters describing the selection criteria for the ECR lifecycle policy:
    * `tag_status` (Required) - Determines whether the lifecycle policy rule that you are adding specifies a tag for an image. Acceptable options are `tagged`, `untagged`, or `any`. If you specify `any`, then all images have the rule evaluated against them. If you specify `tagged`, then you must also specify a `tag_prefix_list` value or a `tag_pattern_list` value. If you specify `untagged`, then you must omit both `tag_prefix_list` and `tag_pattern_list`.
    * `tag_pattern_list` (Required if `tag_status` is set to `tagged` and `tag_prefix_list` isn't specified) - You must specify a comma-separated list of image tag patterns that may contain wildcards (\*) on which to take action with your lifecycle policy. For example, if your images are tagged as `prod`, `prod1`, `prod2`, and so on, you would use the tag pattern list `["prod\*"]` to specify all of them. If you specify multiple tags, only the images with all specified tags are selected. There is a maximum limit of four wildcards (\*) per string. For example, `["*test*1*2*3", "test*1*2*3*"]` is valid but `["test*1*2*3*4*5*6"]` is invalid.
    * `tag_prefix_list` (Required if `tag_status` is set to `tagged` and `tag_pattern_list` isn't specified) - You must specify a comma-separated list of image tag prefixes on which to take action with your lifecycle policy. For example, if your images are tagged as `prod`, `prod1`, `prod2`, and so on, you would use the tag prefix "prod" to specify all of them. If you specify multiple tags, only images with all specified tags are selected.
    * `storage_class` (Required if `count_type` is "sinceImageTransitioned") - The rule will only select images of this storage class. When using a `count_type` of `imageCountMoreThan`, `sinceImagePushed`, or `sinceImagePulled`, the only supported value is `standard`. When using a `count_type` of `sinceImageTransitioned`, this is required, and the only supported value is `archive`. If you omit this, the value of `standard` will be used.
    * `count_type` (Required) - Specify a count type to apply to the images. If `count_type` is set to `imageCountMoreThan`, you also specify `count_number` to create a rule that sets a limit on the number of images that exist in your repository. If `count_type` is set to `sinceImagePushed`, `sinceImagePulled`, or `sinceImageTransitioned`, you also specify `count_unit` and `count_number` to specify a time limit on the images that exist in your repository.
    * `count_unit` (Required if `count_type` is set to `sinceImagePushed`, `sinceImagePulled`, or `sinceImageTransitioned`) - Specify a count unit of `days` to indicate that as the unit of time, in addition to `count_number`, which is the number of days.
    * `count_number` (Required) - Specify a count number. If the `count_type` used is `imageCountMoreThan`, then the value is the maximum number of images that you want to retain in your repository. If the `count_type` used is `sinceImagePushed`, then the value is the maximum age limit for your images. If the `count_type` used is `sinceImagePulled`, then the value is the maximum number of days since the image was last pulled. If the `count_type` used is `sinceImageTransitioned`, then the value is the maximum number of days since the image was archived.
