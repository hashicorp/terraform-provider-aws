# Data Source: aws_network_interfaces

## Example Usage

The following shows outputing all network interface ids in a region.

```hcl
data "aws_network_interfaces" "example" {}

output "example" {
  value = "${data.aws_network_interfaces.example.ids}"
}
```

The following example retrieves a list of all network interface ids with a custom tag of `Name` set to a value of `test`.

```hcl
data "aws_network_interfaces" "example" {
  tags {
    Name = "test"
  }
}

output "example1" {
  value = "${data.aws_network_interfaces.example.ids}"
}
```

The following example retrieves a network interface ids which associated
with specific subnet.

```hcl
data "aws_network_interfaces" "example" {
  filter {
    name = "subnet-id"
    values = ["${aws_subnet.test.id}"]
  }
}

output "example" {
  value = "${data.aws_network_interfaces.example.ids}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags, each pair of which must exactly match
  a pair on the desired network interfaces.

* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.

More complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,
which take the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the field to filter by, as defined by
  [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeNetworkInterfaces.html).

* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field.

## Attributes Reference

* `ids` - A list of all the network interface ids found. This data source will fail if none are found.
