  }
}

output "vpn_connection_id" {
  value = data.aws_vpn_connection.example.vpn_connection_id
}
```

### Find by VPN Connection ID

```terraform
data "aws_vpn_connection" "example" {
  vpn_connection_id = "vpn-abcd1234567890"
}

output "gateway_association_state" {
  value = data.aws_vpn_connection.example.gateway_association_state
