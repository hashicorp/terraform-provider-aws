# Data Source: aws_region

`aws_region` provides details about a specific AWS region.

As well as validating a given region name this resource can be used to
discover the name of the region configured within the provider. The latter
can be useful in a child module which is inheriting an AWS provider
configuration from its parent module.

## Example Usage

the name of the AWS region configured on the provider.

```terraform
data "aws_region" "current" {}
```

regions. The given filters must match exactly one region whose data will be
exported as attributes.

* `name` - (Optional) The full name of the region to select.

* `endpoint` - (Optional) The EC2 endpoint of the region to select.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `name` - The name of the selected region.

* `endpoint` - The EC2 endpoint for the selected region.
