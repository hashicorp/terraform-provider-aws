# Data Source: aws_networkfirewall_firewall_policy

Retrieve information about a firewall policy.

## Example Usage

### Find firewall policy by name

```terraform
data "aws_networkfirewall_firewall_policy" "example" {
  name = var.firewall_policy_name
}
```

### Find firewall policy by ARN

```terraform
data "aws_networkfirewall_firewall_policy" "example" {
  arn = var.firewall_policy_arn
}
```

### Find firewall policy by name and ARN

```terraform
data "aws_networkfirewall_firewall_policy" "example" {
  arn  = var.firewall_policy_arn
  name = var.firewall_policy_name
}
```

AWS Network Firewall does not allow multiple firewall policies with the same name to be created in an account. It is possible, however, to have multiple firewall policies available in a single account with identical `name` values but distinct `arn` values, e.g. firewall policies shared via a [Resource Access Manager (RAM) share][1]. In that case specifying `arn`, or `name` and `arn`, is recommended.

~> **Note:** If there are multiple firewall policies in an account with the same `name`, and `arn` is not specified, the default behavior will return the firewall policy with `name` that was created in the account.
