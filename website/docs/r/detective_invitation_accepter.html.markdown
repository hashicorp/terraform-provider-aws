  graph_arn     = aws_detective_graph.primary.graph_arn
  message       = "Message of the invite"
}

resource "aws_detective_invitation_accepter" "member" {
  provider  = "awsalternate"
  graph_arn = aws_detective_graph.primary.graph_arn

  depends_on = [aws_detective_member.primary]
}
```

## Attribute Reference
