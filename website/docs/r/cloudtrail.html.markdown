# Resource: aws_cloudtrail

Provides a CloudTrail resource.

~> *NOTE:* For a multi-region trail, this resource must be in the home region of the trail.

~> *NOTE:* For an organization trail, this resource must be in the master account of the organization.

## Example Usage

### Basic

Enable CloudTrail to capture all compatible management events in region.
For capturing events from services like IAM, `include_global_service_events` must be enabled.

```hcl
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

resource "aws_cloudtrail" "foobar" {
  name                          = "tf-trail-foobar"
  s3_bucket_name                = "${aws_s3_bucket.foo.id}"
  s3_key_prefix                 = "prefix"
  include_global_service_events = false
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "foo" {
  bucket        = "tf-test-trail"
  force_destroy = true

  policy = <<POLICY
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AWSCloudTrailAclCheck",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
              "Service": "cloudtrail.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetBucketAcl",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::tf-test-trail"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AWSCloudTrailWrite",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
              "Service": "cloudtrail.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::tf-test-trail/prefix/AWSLogs/${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "s3:x-amz-acl": "bucket-owner-full-control"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
POLICY
}
```

### Data Event Logging

CloudTrail can log [Data Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-and-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html#logging-data-events) for certain services such as S3 bucket objects and Lambda function invocations. Additional information about data event configuration can be found in the [CloudTrail API DataResource documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_DataResource.html).

#### Logging All Lambda Function Invocations

```hcl
resource "aws_cloudtrail" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  event_selector {
    read_write_type           = "All"
    include_management_events = true

    data_resource {
      type   = "AWS::Lambda::Function"
      values = ["arn:aws:lambda"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Logging All S3 Bucket Object Events

```hcl
resource "aws_cloudtrail" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  event_selector {
    read_write_type           = "All"
    include_management_events = true

    data_resource {
      type   = "AWS::S3::Object"
      values = ["arn:aws:s3:::"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Logging Individual S3 Bucket Events

```hcl
data "aws_s3_bucket" "important-bucket" {
  bucket = "important-bucket"
}

resource "aws_cloudtrail" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  event_selector {
    read_write_type           = "All"
    include_management_events = true

    data_resource {
      type = "AWS::S3::Object"

      # Make sure to append a trailing '/' to your ARN if you want
      # to monitor all objects in a bucket.
      values = ["${data.aws_s3_bucket.important-bucket.arn}/"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the trail.
* `s3_bucket_name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the S3 bucket designated for publishing log files.
* `s3_key_prefix` - (Optional) Specifies the S3 key prefix that follows
    the name of the bucket you have designated for log file delivery.
* `cloud_watch_logs_role_arn` - (Optional) Specifies the role for the CloudWatch Logs
    endpoint to assume to write to a user’s log group.
* `cloud_watch_logs_group_arn` - (Optional) Specifies a log group name using an Amazon Resource Name (ARN),
    that represents the log group to which CloudTrail logs will be delivered.
* `enable_logging` - (Optional) Enables logging for the trail. Defaults to `true`.
    Setting this to `false` will pause logging.
* `include_global_service_events` - (Optional) Specifies whether the trail is publishing events

* `sns_topic_name` - (Optional) Specifies the name of the Amazon SNS topic
    defined for notification of log file delivery.
* `enable_log_file_validation` - (Optional) Specifies whether log file integrity validation is enabled.
    Defaults to `false`.
* `kms_key_id` - (Optional) Specifies the KMS key ARN to use to encrypt the logs delivered by CloudTrail.
* `event_selector` - (Optional) Specifies an event selector for enabling data event logging. Fields documented below. Please note the [CloudTrail limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/WhatIsCloudTrail-Limits.html) when configuring these.
* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the trail

### Event Selector Arguments

* `read_write_type` (Optional) - Specify if you want your trail to log read-only events, write-only events, or all. By default, the value is All. You can specify only the following value: "ReadOnly", "WriteOnly", "All". Defaults to `All`.
* `include_management_events` (Optional) - Specify if you want your event selector to include management events for your trail.
* `data_resource` (Optional) - Specifies logging data events. Fields documented below.

#### Data Resource Arguments
For **data_resource** the following attributes are supported.

* `type` (Required) - The resource type in which you want to log data events. You can specify only the follwing value: "AWS::S3::Object", "AWS::Lambda::Function"
