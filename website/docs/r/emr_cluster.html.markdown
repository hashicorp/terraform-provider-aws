# aws_emr_cluster

Provides an Elastic MapReduce Cluster, a web service that makes it easy to
process large amounts of data efficiently. See [Amazon Elastic MapReduce Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/elastic-mapreduce/)
for more information.

The `aws_emr_cluster` resource typically requires two IAM roles, one for the EMR Cluster
to use as a service, and another to place on your Cluster Instances to interact
with AWS from those instances. The suggested role policy template for the EMR service is `AmazonElasticMapReduceRole`,
and `AmazonElasticMapReduceforEC2Role` for the EC2 profile. See the [Getting
Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-gs-launch-sample-cluster.html)
guide for more information on these IAM roles. There is also a fully-bootable
example Terraform configuration at the bottom of this page.

### Enable Debug Logging

[Debug logging in EMR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-plan-debugging.html)
is implemented as a step. It is highly recommended to utilize the
[lifecycle configuration block](/docs/configuration/resources.html) with `ignore_changes` if other
steps are being managed outside of Terraform.

```hcl
resource "aws_emr_cluster" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  step {
    action = "TERMINATE_CLUSTER"
    name   = "Setup Hadoop Debugging"

    hadoop_jar_step {
      jar  = "command-runner.jar"
      args = ["state-pusher-script"]
    }
  }

  # Optional: ignore outside changes to running cluster steps
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = ["step"]
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `additional_info` - (Optional) A JSON string for selecting additional features such as adding proxy information. Note: Currently there is no API to retrieve the value of this argument after EMR cluster creation from provider, therefore Terraform cannot detect drift from the actual EMR cluster if its value is changed outside Terraform.
* `service_role` - (Required) IAM role that will be assumed by the Amazon EMR service to access AWS resources
* `security_configuration` - (Optional) The security configuration name to attach to the EMR cluster. Only valid for EMR clusters with `release_label` 4.8.0 or greater
* `core_instance_type` - (Optional) The EC2 instance type of the slave nodes. Cannot be specified if `instance_groups` is set
* `core_instance_count` - (Optional) Number of Amazon EC2 instances used to execute the job flow. EMR will use one node as the cluster's master node and use the remainder of the nodes (`core_instance_count`-1) as core nodes. Cannot be specified if `instance_groups` is set. Default `1`
* `instance_group` - (Optional) A list of `instance_group` objects for each instance group in the cluster. Exactly one of `master_instance_type` and `instance_group` must be specified. If `instance_group` is set, then it must contain a configuration block for at least the `MASTER` instance group type (as well as any additional instance groups). Defined below
* `log_uri` - (Optional) S3 bucket to write the log files of the job flow. If a value
	is not provided, logs are not created

flow. Defined below
* `kerberos_attributes` - (Optional) Kerberos configuration for the cluster. Defined below
* `ebs_root_volume_size` - (Optional) Size in GiB of the EBS root device volume of the Linux AMI that is used for each EC2 instance. Available in Amazon EMR version 4.x and later.
* `custom_ami_id` - (Optional) A custom Amazon Linux AMI for the cluster (instead of an EMR-owned AMI). Available in Amazon EMR version 5.7.0 and later.
* `bootstrap_action` - (Optional) List of bootstrap actions that will be run before Hadoop is started on
	the cluster nodes. Defined below
* `configurations` - (Optional) List of configurations supplied for the EMR cluster you are creating
* `configurations_json` - (Optional) A JSON string for supplying list of configurations for the EMR cluster.

~> **NOTE on configurations_json:** If the `Configurations` value is empty then you should skip
the `Configurations` field instead of providing empty list as value `"Configurations": []`.

```hcl
configurations_json = <<EOF
  [
    {
      "Classification": "hadoop-env",
      "Configurations": [
        {
          "Classification": "export",
          "Properties": {
            "JAVA_HOME": "/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0"
          }
        }
      ],
      "Properties": {}
    }
  ]
EOF
```

* `visible_to_all_users` - (Optional) Whether the job flow is visible to all IAM users of the AWS account associated with the job flow. Default `true`
* `autoscaling_role` - (Optional) An IAM role for automatic scaling policies. The IAM role provides permissions that the automatic scaling feature requires to launch and terminate EC2 instances in an instance group.
* `step` - (Optional) List of steps to run when creating the cluster. Defined below. It is highly recommended to utilize the [lifecycle configuration block](/docs/configuration/resources.html) with `ignore_changes` if other steps are being managed outside of Terraform.
* `tags` - (Optional) list of tags to apply to the EMR Cluster


## ec2_attributes

Attributes for the Amazon EC2 instances running the job flow

* `key_name` - (Optional) Amazon EC2 key pair that can be used to ssh to the master
	node as the user called `hadoop`
* `subnet_id` - (Optional) VPC subnet id where you want the job flow to launch.
Cannot specify the `cc1.4xlarge` instance type for nodes of a job flow launched in a Amazon VPC
* `additional_master_security_groups` - (Optional) String containing a comma separated list of additional Amazon EC2 security group IDs for the master node
* `additional_slave_security_groups` - (Optional) String containing a comma separated list of additional Amazon EC2 security group IDs for the slave nodes as a comma separated string
* `emr_managed_master_security_group` - (Optional) Identifier of the Amazon EC2 EMR-Managed security group for the master node
* `emr_managed_slave_security_group` - (Optional) Identifier of the Amazon EC2 EMR-Managed security group for the slave nodes
* `service_access_security_group` - (Optional) Identifier of the Amazon EC2 service-access security group - required when the cluster runs on a private subnet
* `instance_profile` - (Required) Instance Profile for EC2 instances of the cluster assume this role

~> **NOTE on EMR-Managed security groups:** These security groups will have any
missing inbound or outbound access rules added and maintained by AWS, to ensure
proper communication between instances in a cluster. The EMR service will
maintain these rules for groups provided in `emr_managed_master_security_group`
and `emr_managed_slave_security_group`; attempts to remove the required rules
may succeed, only for the EMR service to re-add them in a matter of minutes.
This may cause Terraform to fail to destroy an environment that contains an EMR
cluster, because the EMR service does not revoke rules added on deletion,
leaving a cyclic dependency between the security groups that prevents their
deletion. To avoid this, use the `revoke_rules_on_delete` optional attribute for
any Security Group used in `emr_managed_master_security_group` and
`emr_managed_slave_security_group`. See [Amazon EMR-Managed Security
Groups](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-man-sec-groups.html)
for more information about the EMR-managed security group rules.

## kerberos_attributes

Attributes for Kerberos configuration

* `ad_domain_join_password` - (Optional) The Active Directory password for `ad_domain_join_user`
* `ad_domain_join_user` - (Optional) Required only when establishing a cross-realm trust with an Active Directory domain. A user with sufficient privileges to join resources to the domain.
* `cross_realm_trust_principal_password` - (Optional) Required only when establishing a cross-realm trust with a KDC in a different realm. The cross-realm principal password, which must be identical across realms.
* `kdc_admin_password` - (Required) The password used within the cluster for the kadmin service on the cluster-dedicated KDC, which maintains Kerberos principals, password policies, and keytabs for the cluster.

By setting this attribute, the instance group is being declared as a Spot Instance, and will implicitly create a Spot request. Leave this blank to use On-Demand Instances. `bid_price` can not be set for the `MASTER` instance group, since that group must always be On-Demand
* `ebs_config` - (Optional) A list of attributes for the EBS volumes attached to each instance in the instance group. Each `ebs_config` defined will result in additional EBS volumes being attached to _each_ instance in the instance group. Defined below
