# Resource: aws_emr_cluster

Provides an Elastic MapReduce Cluster, a web service that makes it easy to
process large amounts of data efficiently. See [Amazon Elastic MapReduce Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/elastic-mapreduce/)
for more information.

To configure [Instance Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-instance-group-configuration.html#emr-plan-instance-groups) for [task nodes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-master-core-task-nodes.html#emr-plan-task), see the [`aws_emr_instance_group` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/emr_instance_group.html).

-> Support for [Instance Fleets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-instance-group-configuration.html#emr-plan-instance-fleets) will be made available in an upcoming release.

The `aws_emr_cluster` resource typically requires two IAM roles, one for the EMR Cluster
to use as a service, and another to place on your Cluster Instances to interact
with AWS from those instances. The suggested role policy template for the EMR service is `AmazonElasticMapReduceRole`,
and `AmazonElasticMapReduceforEC2Role` for the EC2 profile. See the [Getting
Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-gs-launch-sample-cluster.html)
guide for more information on these IAM roles. There is also a fully-bootable
example Terraform configuration at the bottom of this page.

### Enable Debug Logging

[Debug logging in EMR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-plan-debugging.html)
is implemented as a step. It is highly recommended to utilize the
[lifecycle configuration block](/docs/configuration/resources.html) with `ignore_changes` if other
steps are being managed outside of Terraform.

```hcl
resource "aws_emr_cluster" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  step {
    action_on_failure = "TERMINATE_CLUSTER"
    name              = "Setup Hadoop Debugging"

    hadoop_jar_step {
      jar  = "command-runner.jar"
      args = ["state-pusher-script"]
    }
  }

  # Optional: ignore outside changes to running cluster steps
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = ["step"]
  }
}
```

### Multiple Node Master Instance Group

Available in EMR version 5.23.0 and later, an EMR Cluster can be launched with three master nodes for high availability. Additional information about this functionality and its requirements can be found in the [EMR Management Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-plan-ha.html).

```hcl
# This configuration is for illustrative purposes and highlights
# only relevant configurations for working with this functionality.

# Map public IP on launch must be enabled for public (Internet accessible) subnets
resource "aws_subnet" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
}

resource "aws_emr_cluster" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  # EMR version must be 5.23.0 or later
  release_label = "emr-5.24.1"

  # Termination protection is automatically enabled for multiple masters
  # To destroy the cluster, this must be configured to false and applied first
  termination_protection = true

  ec2_attributes {
    # ... other configuration ...

    subnet_id = "${aws_subnet.example.id}"
  }

  master_instance_group {
    # ... other configuration ...

    # Master instance count must be set to 3
    instance_count = 3
  }

  # core_instance_group must be configured
  core_instance_group {
    # ... other configuration ...
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

  [
    {
      "Classification": "hadoop-env",
      "Configurations": [
        {

      "Properties": {}
    }
  ]
EOF
```

* `visible_to_all_users` - (Optional) Whether the job flow is visible to all IAM users of the AWS account associated with the job flow. Default `true`
* `autoscaling_role` - (Optional) An IAM role for automatic scaling policies. The IAM role provides permissions that the automatic scaling feature requires to launch and terminate EC2 instances in an instance group.
* `step` - (Optional) List of steps to run when creating the cluster. Defined below. It is highly recommended to utilize the [lifecycle configuration block](/docs/configuration/resources.html) with `ignore_changes` if other steps are being managed outside of Terraform. This argument is processed in [attribute-as-blocks mode](/docs/configuration/attr-as-blocks.html).
* `tags` - (Optional) list of tags to apply to the EMR Cluster

## core_instance_group Configuration Block

Supported arguments for the `core_instance_group` configuration block:

* `bid_price` - (Optional) Bid price for each EC2 instance in the instance group, expressed in USD. By setting this attribute, the instance group is being declared as a Spot Instance, and will implicitly create a Spot request. Leave this blank to use On-Demand Instances.
* `ebs_config` - (Optional) Configuration block(s) for EBS volumes attached to each instance in the instance group. Detailed below.
* `instance_count` - (Optional) Target number of instances for the instance group. Must be at least 1. Defaults to 1.
* `name` - (Optional) Friendly name given to the instance group.

## ec2_attributes

Attributes for the Amazon EC2 instances running the job flow

* `key_name` - (Optional) Amazon EC2 key pair that can be used to ssh to the master node as the user called `hadoop`
* `subnet_id` - (Optional) VPC subnet id where you want the job flow to launch. Cannot specify the `cc1.4xlarge` instance type for nodes of a job flow launched in a Amazon VPC
* `additional_master_security_groups` - (Optional) String containing a comma separated list of additional Amazon EC2 security group IDs for the master node

* `service_access_security_group` - (Optional) Identifier of the Amazon EC2 service-access security group - required when the cluster runs on a private subnet
* `instance_profile` - (Required) Instance Profile for EC2 instances of the cluster assume this role

~> **NOTE on EMR-Managed security groups:** These security groups will have any
missing inbound or outbound access rules added and maintained by AWS, to ensure
proper communication between instances in a cluster. The EMR service will
maintain these rules for groups provided in `emr_managed_master_security_group`
and `emr_managed_slave_security_group`; attempts to remove the required rules
may succeed, only for the EMR service to re-add them in a matter of minutes.
This may cause Terraform to fail to destroy an environment that contains an EMR
cluster, because the EMR service does not revoke rules added on deletion,
leaving a cyclic dependency between the security groups that prevents their
deletion. To avoid this, use the `revoke_rules_on_delete` optional attribute for
any Security Group used in `emr_managed_master_security_group` and
`emr_managed_slave_security_group`. See [Amazon EMR-Managed Security
Groups](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-man-sec-groups.html)
for more information about the EMR-managed security group rules.

## kerberos_attributes

## Import

EMR clusters can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import aws_emr_cluster.cluster j-123456ABCDEF
```

Since the API does not return the actual values for Kerberos configurations, environments with those Terraform configurations will need to use the [`lifecycle` configuration block `ignore_changes` argument](/docs/configuration/resources.html#ignore_changes) available to all Terraform resources to prevent perpetual differences, e.g.

```hcl
resource "aws_emr_cluster" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = ["kerberos_attributes"]
  }
}
```
