# Resource: aws_s3control_access_point_policy

Provides a resource to manage an S3 Access Point resource policy.

~> **NOTE on Access Points and Access Point Policies:** Terraform provides both a standalone Access Point Policy resource and an [Access Point](s3_access_point.html) resource with a resource policy defined in-line. You cannot use an Access Point with in-line resource policy in conjunction with an Access Point Policy resource. Doing so will cause a conflict of policies and will overwrite the access point's resource policy.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "example"
}

resource "aws_s3_access_point" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
  name   = "example"

  public_access_block_configuration {
    block_public_acls       = true
    block_public_policy     = false
    ignore_public_acls      = true
    restrict_public_buckets = false
  }

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [policy]
  }
}

resource "aws_s3control_access_point_policy" "example" {
  access_point_arn = aws_s3_access_point.example.arn

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2008-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Effect = "Allow"
      Action = "s3:GetObjectTagging"
      Principal = {
        AWS = "*"
      }
      Resource = "${aws_s3_access_point.example.arn}/object/*"
    }]
  })
}
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `region` - (Optional) Region where this resource will be [managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints). Defaults to the Region set in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#aws-configuration-reference).
* `access_point_arn` - (Required) The ARN of the access point that you want to associate with the specified policy.
* `policy` - (Required) The policy that you want to apply to the specified access point.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `has_public_access_policy` - Indicates whether this access point currently has a policy that allows public access.
* `id` - The AWS account ID and access point name separated by a colon (`:`).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Access Point policies using the `access_point_arn`. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_s3control_access_point_policy.example
  id = "arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/example"
}
```

Using `terraform import`, import Access Point policies using the `access_point_arn`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_s3control_access_point_policy.example arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/example
```
