# Resource: aws_ram_principal_association

Provides a Resource Access Manager (RAM) principal association. Depending if [RAM Sharing with AWS Organizations is enabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/getting-started-sharing.html#getting-started-sharing-orgs), the RAM behavior with different principal types changes.

When RAM Sharing with AWS Organizations is enabled:

- For AWS Account ID, Organization, and Organizational Unit principals within the same AWS Organization, no resource share invitation is sent and resources become available automatically after creating the association.
- For AWS Account ID principals outside the AWS Organization, a resource share invitation is sent and must be accepted before resources become available. See the [`aws_ram_resource_share_accepter` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/ram_resource_share_accepter.html) to accept these invitations.

When RAM Sharing with AWS Organizations is not enabled:

- Organization and Organizational Unit principals cannot be used.
- For AWS Account ID principals, a resource share invitation is sent and must be accepted before resources become available. See the [`aws_ram_resource_share_accepter` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/ram_resource_share_accepter.html) to accept these invitations.

## Example Usage

### AWS Account ID

```hcl
resource "aws_ram_resource_share" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...
  allow_external_principals = true
}

resource "aws_ram_principal_association" "example" {
  principal          = "111111111111"
  resource_share_arn = "${aws_ram_resource_share.example.arn}"
}
```

### AWS Organization

```hcl
resource "aws_ram_principal_association" "example" {
  principal          = "${aws_organizations_organization.example.arn}"
  resource_share_arn = "${aws_ram_resource_share.example.arn}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `principal` - (Required) The principal to associate with the resource share. Possible values are an AWS account ID, an AWS Organizations Organization ARN, or an AWS Organizations Organization Unit ARN.
* `resource_share_arn` - (Required) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource share.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Resource Share and the principal, separated by a comma.

## Import

RAM Principal Associations can be imported using their Resource Share ARN and the `principal` separated by a comma, e.g.

```
$ terraform import aws_ram_principal_association.example arn:aws:ram:eu-west-1:123456789012:resource-share/73da1ab9-b94a-4ba3-8eb4-45917f7f4b12,123456789012
