# Resource: aws_cloud9_environment_ec2

Provides a Cloud9 EC2 Development Environment.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```terraform
resource "aws_cloud9_environment_ec2" "example" {
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  name          = "example-env"
}
```

Get the URL of the Cloud9 environment after creation:

```terraform
resource "aws_cloud9_environment_ec2" "example" {
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

data "aws_instance" "cloud9_instance" {
  filter {
    name = "tag:aws:cloud9:environment"
    values = [
    aws_cloud9_environment_ec2.example.id]
  }
}

output "cloud9_url" {
  value = "https://${var.region}.console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/ide/${aws_cloud9_environment_ec2.example.id}"
}
```

Allocate a static IP to the Cloud9 environment:

```terraform
resource "aws_cloud9_environment_ec2" "example" {
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

data "aws_instance" "cloud9_instance" {
  filter {
    name = "tag:aws:cloud9:environment"
    values = [
    aws_cloud9_environment_ec2.example.id]
  }
}

resource "aws_eip" "cloud9_eip" {
  instance = data.aws_instance.cloud9_instance.id
  vpc      = true
}

output "cloud9_public_ip" {
  value = aws_eip.cloud9_eip.public_ip
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the environment.
* `instance_type` - (Required) The type of instance to connect to the environment, e.g., `t2.micro`.
* `automatic_stop_time_minutes` - (Optional) The number of minutes until the running instance is shut down after the environment has last been used.
* `description` - (Optional) The description of the environment.
