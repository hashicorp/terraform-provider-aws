# Resource: aws_ses_domain_identity_verification

Represents a successful verification of an SES domain identity.

Most commonly, this resource is used together with [`aws_route53_record`](route53_record.html) and
[`aws_ses_domain_identity`](ses_domain_identity.html) to request an SES domain identity,
deploy the required DNS verification records, and wait for verification to complete.

~> **WARNING:** This resource implements a part of the verification workflow. It does not represent a real-world entity in AWS, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "aws_ses_domain_identity" "example" {
  domain = "example.com"
}

resource "aws_route53_record" "example_amazonses_verification_record" {
  zone_id = "${aws_route53_zone.example.zone_id}"
  name    = "_amazonses.${aws_ses_domain_identity.example.id}"
  type    = "TXT"
  ttl     = "600"
  records = ["${aws_ses_domain_identity.example.verification_token}"]
}

resource "aws_ses_domain_identity_verification" "example_verification" {
  domain = "${aws_ses_domain_identity.example.id}"

  depends_on = ["aws_route53_record.example_amazonses_verification_record"]
}
```

## Argument Reference
