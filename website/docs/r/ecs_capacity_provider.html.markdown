# Resource: aws_ecs_capacity_provider

Provides an ECS cluster capacity provider. More information can be found on the [ECS Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cluster-capacity-providers.html).

~> **NOTE:** Associating an ECS Capacity Provider to an Auto Scaling Group will automatically add the `AmazonECSManaged` tag to the Auto Scaling Group. This tag should be included in the `aws_autoscaling_group` resource configuration to prevent Terraform from removing it in subsequent executions as well as ensuring the `AmazonECSManaged` tag is propagated to all EC2 Instances in the Auto Scaling Group if `min_size` is above 0 on creation. Any EC2 Instances in the Auto Scaling Group without this tag must be manually be updated, otherwise they may cause unexpected scaling behavior and metrics.

~> **NOTE:** You must specify exactly one of `auto_scaling_group_provider` or `managed_instances_provider`. When using `managed_instances_provider`, the `cluster` parameter is required. When using `auto_scaling_group_provider`, the `cluster` parameter must not be set.

## Example Usage

### Auto Scaling Group Provider

```terraform
resource "aws_autoscaling_group" "example" {
  # ... other configuration, including potentially other tags ...

  tag {
    key                 = "AmazonECSManaged"
    value               = true
    propagate_at_launch = true
  }
}

resource "aws_ecs_capacity_provider" "example" {
  name = "example"

  auto_scaling_group_provider {
    auto_scaling_group_arn         = aws_autoscaling_group.example.arn
    managed_termination_protection = "ENABLED"

    managed_scaling {
      maximum_scaling_step_size = 1000
      minimum_scaling_step_size = 1
      status                    = "ENABLED"
      target_capacity           = 10
    }
  }
}
```

### Managed Instances Provider

```terraform
resource "aws_ecs_capacity_provider" "example" {
  name    = "example"
  cluster = "my-cluster"

  managed_instances_provider {
    infrastructure_role_arn = aws_iam_role.ecs_infrastructure.arn
    propagate_tags          = "TASK_DEFINITION"

    instance_launch_template {
      ec2_instance_profile_arn = aws_iam_instance_profile.ecs_instance.arn
      monitoring               = "ENABLED"

      network_configuration {
        subnets         = [aws_subnet.example.id]
        security_groups = [aws_security_group.example.id]
      }

      storage_configuration {
        storage_size_gib = 30
      }

      instance_requirements {
        memory_mib {
          min = 1024
          max = 8192
        }

        vcpu_count {
          min = 1
          max = 4
        }

        instance_generations = ["current"]
        cpu_manufacturers    = ["intel", "amd"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

* `on_demand_max_price_percentage_over_lowest_price` - (Optional) The price protection threshold for On-Demand Instances, as a percentage higher than an identified On-Demand price. The identified On-Demand price is the price of the lowest priced current generation C, M, or R instance type with your specified attributes. When Amazon ECS selects instance types with your attributes, it will exclude instance types whose price exceeds your specified threshold.
* `require_hibernate_support` - (Optional) Indicates whether the instance types must support hibernation. When set to `true`, only instance types that support hibernation are selected.
* `spot_max_price_percentage_over_lowest_price` - (Optional) The maximum price for Spot instances as a percentage over the lowest priced On-Demand instance. This helps control Spot instance costs while maintaining access to capacity.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - ARN that identifies the capacity provider.
* `tags_all` - Map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_ecs_capacity_provider.example
  identity = {
    "arn" = "arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:123456789012:capacity-provider/example"
  }
}

resource "aws_ecs_capacity_provider" "example" {
  ### Configuration omitted for brevity ###
}
```

### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `arn` (String) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ECS capacity provider.

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import ECS Capacity Providers using the `arn`. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_ecs_capacity_provider.example
  id = "arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:123456789012:capacity-provider/example"
}
```

Using `terraform import`, import ECS Capacity Providers using the `arn`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_ecs_capacity_provider.example arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:123456789012:capacity-provider/example
```
