# Resource: aws_eks_cluster

Manages an EKS Cluster.

> **Hands-on:** For an example of `aws_eks_cluster` in use, follow the [Provision an EKS Cluster](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/eks) tutorial on HashiCorp Learn.

## Example Usage

### EKS Cluster

```terraform
resource "aws_eks_cluster" "example" {
  name = "example"

  access_config {
    authentication_mode = "API"
  }

  role_arn = aws_iam_role.example.arn
  version  = "1.31"

  vpc_config {
    subnet_ids = [
      aws_subnet.az1.id,
      aws_subnet.az2.id,
      aws_subnet.az3.id,
    ]
  }

  # Ensure that IAM Role permissions are created before and deleted
  # after EKS Cluster handling. Otherwise, EKS will not be able to
  # properly delete EKS managed EC2 infrastructure such as Security Groups.
  depends_on = [
    aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.cluster_AmazonEKSClusterPolicy,
  ]
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "cluster" {
  name = "eks-cluster-example"
  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = [
          "sts:AssumeRole",
          "sts:TagSession"
        ]
        Effect = "Allow"
        Principal = {
          Service = "eks.amazonaws.com"
        }
      },
    ]
  })
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "cluster_AmazonEKSClusterPolicy" {
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEKSClusterPolicy"
  role       = aws_iam_role.cluster.name
}
```

### EKS Cluster with EKS Auto Mode

~> **NOTE:** When using EKS Auto Mode `compute_config.enabled`, `kubernetes_network_config.elastic_load_balancing.enabled`, and `storage_config.block_storage.enabled` must *ALL be set to `true`. Likewise for disabling EKS Auto Mode, all three arguments must be set to `false`. Enabling EKS Auto Mode also requires that `bootstrap_self_managed_addons` is set to `false`.

```terraform
resource "aws_eks_cluster" "example" {
  name = "example"

    authentication_mode = "API"
  }

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `name` â€“ (Required) Name of the cluster. Must be between 1-100 characters in length. Must begin with an alphanumeric character, and must only contain alphanumeric characters, dashes and underscores (`^[0-9A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9\-_]*$`).
* `role_arn` - (Required) ARN of the IAM role that provides permissions for the Kubernetes control plane to make calls to AWS API operations on your behalf. Ensure the resource configuration includes explicit dependencies on the IAM Role permissions by adding [`depends_on`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/meta-arguments/depends_on.html) if using the [`aws_iam_role_policy` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/iam_role_policy.html) or [`aws_iam_role_policy_attachment` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/iam_role_policy_attachment.html), otherwise EKS cannot delete EKS managed EC2 infrastructure such as Security Groups on EKS Cluster deletion.
* `vpc_config` - (Required) Configuration block for the VPC associated with your cluster. Amazon EKS VPC resources have specific requirements to work properly with Kubernetes. For more information, see [Cluster VPC Considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/network_reqs.html) and [Cluster Security Group Considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/sec-group-reqs.html) in the Amazon EKS User Guide. Detailed below. Also contains attributes detailed in the Attributes section.

The following arguments are optional:

### compute_config

The `compute_config` configuration block supports the following arguments:

If you don't specify a block, Kubernetes assigns addresses from either the 10.100.0.0/16 or 172.20.0.0/16 CIDR blocks. We recommend that you specify a block that does not overlap with resources in other networks that are peered or connected to your VPC. You can only specify a custom CIDR block when you create a cluster, changing this value will force a new cluster to be created. The block must meet the following requirements:

    * Within one of the following private IP address blocks: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, or 192.168.0.0/16.

#### elastic_load_balancing

The `elastic_load_balancing` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `enabled` - (Optional) Indicates if the load balancing capability is enabled on your EKS Auto Mode cluster. If the load balancing capability is enabled, EKS Auto Mode will create and delete load balancers in your Amazon Web Services account.

### outpost_config

The `outpost_config` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `control_plane_instance_type` - (Required) The Amazon EC2 instance type that you want to use for your local Amazon EKS cluster on Outposts. The instance type that you specify is used for all Kubernetes control plane instances. The instance type can't be changed after cluster creation. Choose an instance type based on the number of nodes that your cluster will have. If your cluster will have:

    * 1â€“20 nodes, then we recommend specifying a large instance type.

    * 21â€“100 nodes, then we recommend specifying an xlarge instance type.

    * 101â€“250 nodes, then we recommend specifying a 2xlarge instance type.

    For a list of the available Amazon EC2 instance types, see Compute and storage in AWS Outposts rack features  The control plane is not automatically scaled by Amazon EKS.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

Note that the `update` timeout is used separately for both `version` and `vpc_config` update timeouts.
* `delete` - (Default `15m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import EKS Clusters using the `name`. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_eks_cluster.my_cluster
  id = "my_cluster"
}
```

Using `terraform import`, import EKS Clusters using the `name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_eks_cluster.my_cluster my_cluster
```
