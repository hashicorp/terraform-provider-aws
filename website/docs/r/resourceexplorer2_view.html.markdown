## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Resource Explorer views using the `arn`. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_resourceexplorer2_view.example
  id = "arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-west-2:123456789012:view/exampleview/e0914f6c-6c27-4b47-b5d4-6b28381a2421"
