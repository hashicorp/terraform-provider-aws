# Resource: aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration

Provides an S3 bucket CORS configuration resource. For more information about CORS, go to [Enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/cors.html) in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

~> **NOTE:** S3 Buckets only support a single CORS configuration. Declaring multiple `aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration` resources to the same S3 Bucket will cause a perpetual difference in configuration.

-> This resource cannot be used with S3 directory buckets.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "mybucket"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id

  cors_rule {
    allowed_headers = ["*"]
    allowed_methods = ["PUT", "POST"]
    allowed_origins = ["https://s3-website-test.hashicorp.com"]
    expose_headers  = ["ETag"]
    max_age_seconds = 3000
  }

  cors_rule {
    allowed_methods = ["GET"]
    allowed_origins = ["*"]
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `region` - (Optional) Region where this resource will be [managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints). Defaults to the Region set in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#aws-configuration-reference).
* `bucket` - (Required, Forces new resource) Name of the bucket.
* `expected_bucket_owner` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Account ID of the expected bucket owner.
* `cors_rule` - (Required) Set of origins and methods (cross-origin access that you want to allow). [See below](#cors_rule). You can configure up to 100 rules.

### cors_rule

The `cors_rule` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `allowed_headers` - (Optional) Set of Headers that are specified in the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` header.
* `allowed_methods` - (Required) Set of HTTP methods that you allow the origin to execute. Valid values are `GET`, `PUT`, `HEAD`, `POST`, and `DELETE`.
* `allowed_origins` - (Required) Set of origins you want customers to be able to access the bucket from.
* `expose_headers` - (Optional) Set of headers in the response that you want customers to be able to access from their applications (for example, from a JavaScript `XMLHttpRequest` object).
* `id` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the rule. The value cannot be longer than 255 characters.
* `max_age_seconds` - (Optional) Time in seconds that your browser is to cache the preflight response for the specified resource.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The `bucket` or `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`) if the latter is provided.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import S3 bucket CORS configuration using the `bucket` or using the `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`). For example:

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket is the same account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket`:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration.example
  id = "bucket-name"
}
```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket differs from the account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`):

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration.example
  id = "bucket-name,123456789012"
}
```

**Using `terraform import` to import** S3 bucket CORS configuration using the `bucket` or using the `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`). For example:

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket is the same account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket`:

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration.example bucket-name
```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket differs from the account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`):

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration.example bucket-name,123456789012
```
