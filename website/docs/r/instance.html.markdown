# Resource: aws_instance

Provides an EC2 instance resource. This allows instances to be created, updated, and deleted. Instances also support [provisioning](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/index.html).

## Example Usage

### Basic Example Using AMI Lookup

```terraform
data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "virtualization-type"
    values = ["hvm"]
  }

  owners = ["099720109477"] # Canonical
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = "t3.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "HelloWorld"
  }
}
```

### Network and Credit Specification Example

```terraform
resource "aws_vpc" "my_vpc" {
  cidr_block = "172.16.0.0/16"

  tags = {
    Name = "tf-example"
  }
}

resource "aws_subnet" "my_subnet" {
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id
  cidr_block        = "172.16.10.0/24"
  availability_zone = "us-west-2a"

  tags = {
    Name = "tf-example"
  }
}

resource "aws_network_interface" "foo" {
  subnet_id   = aws_subnet.my_subnet.id
  private_ips = ["172.16.10.100"]

  tags = {
    Name = "primary_network_interface"
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "foo" {
  ami           = "ami-005e54dee72cc1d00" # us-west-2
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  network_interface {
    network_interface_id = aws_network_interface.foo.id
    device_index         = 0
  }

  credit_specification {
    cpu_credits = "unlimited"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `ami` - (Optional) AMI to use for the instance. Required unless `launch_template` is specified and the Launch Template specifes an AMI. If an AMI is specified in the Launch Template, setting `ami` will override the AMI specified in the Launch Template.
* `associate_public_ip_address` - (Optional) Whether to associate a public IP address with an instance in a VPC.
* `availability_zone` - (Optional) AZ to start the instance in.

* `capacity_reservation_specification` - (Optional) Describes an instance's Capacity Reservation targeting option. See [Capacity Reservation Specification](#capacity-reservation-specification) below for more details.

-> **NOTE:** Changing `cpu_core_count` and/or `cpu_threads_per_core` will cause the resource to be destroyed and re-created.

* `cpu_core_count` - (Optional) Sets the number of CPU cores for an instance. This option is only supported on creation of instance type that support CPU Options [CPU Cores and Threads Per CPU Core Per Instance Type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-optimize-cpu.html#cpu-options-supported-instances-values) - specifying this option for unsupported instance types will return an error from the EC2 API.
* `cpu_threads_per_core` - (Optional - has no effect unless `cpu_core_count` is also set)  If set to to 1, hyperthreading is disabled on the launched instance. Defaults to 2 if not set. See [Optimizing CPU Options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-optimize-cpu.html) for more information.
* `credit_specification` - (Optional) Configuration block for customizing the credit specification of the instance. See [Credit Specification](#credit-specification) below for more details. Terraform will only perform drift detection of its value when present in a configuration. Removing this configuration on existing instances will only stop managing it. It will not change the configuration back to the default for the instance type.
* `disable_api_stop` - (Optional) If true, enables [EC2 Instance Stop Protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Stop_Start.html#Using_StopProtection).

* `instance_initiated_shutdown_behavior` - (Optional) Shutdown behavior for the instance. Amazon defaults this to `stop` for EBS-backed instances and `terminate` for instance-store instances. Cannot be set on instance-store instances. See [Shutdown Behavior](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/terminating-instances.html#Using_ChangingInstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior) for more information.
* `instance_type` - (Optional) The instance type to use for the instance. Updates to this field will trigger a stop/start of the EC2 instance.
* `ipv6_address_count`- (Optional) A number of IPv6 addresses to associate with the primary network interface. Amazon EC2 chooses the IPv6 addresses from the range of your subnet.
* `ipv6_addresses` - (Optional) Specify one or more IPv6 addresses from the range of the subnet to associate with the primary network interface

* `private_dns_name_options` - (Optional) The options for the instance hostname. The default values are inherited from the subnet. See [Private DNS Name Options](#private-dns-name-options) below for more details.
* `private_ip` - (Optional) Private IP address to associate with the instance in a VPC.
* `root_block_device` - (Optional) Configuration block to customize details about the root block device of the instance. See [Block Devices](#ebs-ephemeral-and-root-block-devices) below for details. When accessing this as an attribute reference, it is a list containing one object.
* `secondary_private_ips` - (Optional) A list of secondary private IPv4 addresses to assign to the instance's primary network interface (eth0) in a VPC. Can only be assigned to the primary network interface (eth0) attached at instance creation, not a pre-existing network interface i.e., referenced in a `network_interface` block. Refer to the [Elastic network interfaces documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html#AvailableIpPerENI) to see the maximum number of private IP addresses allowed per instance type.
* `security_groups` - (Optional, EC2-Classic and default VPC only) A list of security group names to associate with.

-> **NOTE:** If you are creating Instances in a VPC, use `vpc_security_group_ids` instead.

* `source_dest_check` - (Optional) Controls if traffic is routed to the instance when the destination address does not match the instance. Used for NAT or VPNs. Defaults true.
* `subnet_id` - (Optional) VPC Subnet ID to launch in.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. Note that these tags apply to the instance and not block storage devices. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `tenancy` - (Optional) Tenancy of the instance (if the instance is running in a VPC). An instance with a tenancy of dedicated runs on single-tenant hardware. The host tenancy is not supported for the import-instance command.
* `user_data` - (Optional) User data to provide when launching the instance. Do not pass gzip-compressed data via this argument; see `user_data_base64` instead. Updates to this field will trigger a stop/start of the EC2 instance by default. If the `user_data_replace_on_change` is set then updates to this field will trigger a destroy and recreate.
* `user_data_base64` - (Optional) Can be used instead of `user_data` to pass base64-encoded binary data directly. Use this instead of `user_data` whenever the value is not a valid UTF-8 string. For example, gzip-encoded user data must be base64-encoded and passed via this argument to avoid corruption. Updates to this field will trigger a stop/start of the EC2 instance by default. If the `user_data_replace_on_change` is set then updates to this field will trigger a destroy and recreate.
* `user_data_replace_on_change` - (Optional) When used in combination with `user_data` or `user_data_base64` will trigger a destroy and recreate when set to `true`. Defaults to `false` if not set.
* `volume_tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign, at instance-creation time, to root and EBS volumes.

~> **NOTE:** Do not use `volume_tags` if you plan to manage block device tags outside the `aws_instance` configuration, such as using `tags` in an [`aws_ebs_volume`](/docs/providers/aws/r/ebs_volume.html) resource attached via [`aws_volume_attachment`](/docs/providers/aws/r/volume_attachment.html). Doing so will result in resource cycling and inconsistent behavior.

* `vpc_security_group_ids` - (Optional, VPC only) A list of security group IDs to associate with.

### Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/blocks/resources/syntax.html#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 10 mins) Used when launching the instance (until it reaches the initial `running` state)
* `update` - (Defaults to 10 mins) Used when stopping and starting the instance when necessary during update - e.g., when changing instance type
* `delete` - (Defaults to 20 mins) Used when terminating the instance

### Capacity Reservation Specification

~> **NOTE:** You can specify only one argument at a time. If you specify both `capacity_reservation_preference` and `capacity_reservation_target`, the request fails. Modifying `capacity_reservation_preference` or `capacity_reservation_target` in this block requires the instance to be in `stopped` state.

Capacity reservation specification can be applied/modified to the EC2 Instance at creation time or when the instance is `stopped`.

The `capacity_reservation_specification` block supports the following:

* `capacity_reservation_preference` - (Optional) Indicates the instance's Capacity Reservation preferences. Can be `"open"` or `"none"`. (Default: `"open"`).
* `capacity_reservation_target` - (Optional) Information about the target Capacity Reservation. See [Capacity Reservation Target](#capacity-reservation-target) below for more details.

For more information, see the documentation on [Capacity Reservations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/capacity-reservations-using.html).

### Capacity Reservation Target

~> **NOTE:** Modifying `capacity_reservation_id` in this block requires the instance to be in `stopped` state.

Describes a target Capacity Reservation.

This `capacity_reservation_target` block supports the following:

* `capacity_reservation_id` - (Optional) The ID of the Capacity Reservation in which to run the instance.
* `capacity_reservation_resource_group_arn` - (Optional) The ARN of the Capacity Reservation resource group in which to run the instance.

### Credit Specification

The `credit_specification` block supports the following:

* `cpu_credits` - (Optional) Credit option for CPU usage. Valid values include `standard` or `unlimited`. T3 instances are launched as unlimited by default. T2 instances are launched as standard by default.

### EBS, Ephemeral, and Root Block Devices

Each of the `*_block_device` attributes control a portion of the EC2 Instance's "Block Device Mapping". For more information, see the [AWS Block Device Mapping documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/block-device-mapping-concepts.html).

The `root_block_device` block supports the following:

* `delete_on_termination` - (Optional) Whether the volume should be destroyed on instance termination. Defaults to `true`.
* `encrypted` - (Optional) Whether to enable volume encryption. Defaults to `false`. Must be configured to perform drift detection.
* `iops` - (Optional) Amount of provisioned [IOPS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-io-characteristics.html). Only valid for volume_type of `io1`, `io2` or `gp3`.
* `kms_key_id` - (Optional) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS Key to use when encrypting the volume. Must be configured to perform drift detection.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the device.
* `throughput` - (Optional) Throughput to provision for a volume in mebibytes per second (MiB/s). This is only valid for `volume_type` of `gp3`.
* `volume_size` - (Optional) Size of the volume in gibibytes (GiB).
* `volume_type` - (Optional) Type of volume. Valid values include `standard`, `gp2`, `gp3`, `io1`, `io2`, `sc1`, or `st1`. Defaults to `gp2`.

Modifying the `encrypted` or `kms_key_id` settings of the `root_block_device` requires resource replacement.

Each `ebs_block_device` block supports the following:

* `delete_on_termination` - (Optional) Whether the volume should be destroyed on instance termination. Defaults to `true`.
* `device_name` - (Required) Name of the device to mount.
* `encrypted` - (Optional) Enables [EBS encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) on the volume. Defaults to `false`. Cannot be used with `snapshot_id`. Must be configured to perform drift detection.
* `iops` - (Optional) Amount of provisioned [IOPS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-io-characteristics.html). Only valid for volume_type of `io1`, `io2` or `gp3`.
* `kms_key_id` - (Optional) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS Key to use when encrypting the volume. Must be configured to perform drift detection.
* `snapshot_id` - (Optional) Snapshot ID to mount.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the device.
* `throughput` - (Optional) Throughput to provision for a volume in mebibytes per second (MiB/s). This is only valid for `volume_type` of `gp3`.
* `volume_size` - (Optional) Size of the volume in gibibytes (GiB).
* `volume_type` - (Optional) Type of volume. Valid values include `standard`, `gp2`, `gp3`, `io1`, `io2`, `sc1`, or `st1`. Defaults to `gp2`.

~> **NOTE:** Currently, changes to the `ebs_block_device` configuration of _existing_ resources cannot be automatically detected by Terraform. To manage changes and attachments of an EBS block to an instance, use the `aws_ebs_volume` and `aws_volume_attachment` resources instead. If you use `ebs_block_device` on an `aws_instance`, Terraform will assume management over the full set of non-root EBS block devices for the instance, treating additional block devices as drift. For this reason, `ebs_block_device` cannot be mixed with external `aws_ebs_volume` and `aws_volume_attachment` resources for a given instance.

Each `ephemeral_block_device` block supports the following:

* `device_name` - The name of the block device to mount on the instance.
* `no_device` - (Optional) Suppresses the specified device included in the AMI's block device mapping.
* `virtual_name` - (Optional) [Instance Store Device Name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html#InstanceStoreDeviceNames) (e.g., `ephemeral0`).

Each AWS Instance type has a different set of Instance Store block devices available for attachment. AWS [publishes a list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html#StorageOnInstanceTypes) of which ephemeral devices are available on each type. The devices are always identified by the `virtual_name` in the format `ephemeral{0..N}`.

### Enclave Options

-> **NOTE:** Changing `enabled` will cause the resource to be destroyed and re-created.

Enclave options apply to the instance at boot time.

The `enclave_options` block supports the following:

* `enabled` - (Optional) Whether Nitro Enclaves will be enabled on the instance. Defaults to `false`.

For more information, see the documentation on [Nitro Enclaves](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave.html).

### Maintenance Options

The `maintenance_options` block supports the following:

* `auto_recovery` - (Optional) The automatic recovery behavior of the Instance. Can be `"default"` or `"disabled"`. See [Recover your instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-recover.html) for more details.

### Metadata Options

Metadata options can be applied/modified to the EC2 Instance at any time.

The `metadata_options` block supports the following:

* `http_endpoint` - (Optional) Whether the metadata service is available. Valid values include `enabled` or `disabled`. Defaults to `enabled`.
* `http_put_response_hop_limit` - (Optional) Desired HTTP PUT response hop limit for instance metadata requests. The larger the number, the further instance metadata requests can travel. Valid values are integer from `1` to `64`. Defaults to `1`.
* `http_tokens` - (Optional) Whether or not the metadata service requires session tokens, also referred to as _Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2)_. Valid values include `optional` or `required`. Defaults to `optional`.
* `instance_metadata_tags` - (optional) Enables or disables access to instance tags from the instance metadata service. Valid values include `enabled` or `disabled`. Defaults to `disabled`.

For more information, see the documentation on the [Instance Metadata Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html).

### Network Interfaces

Each of the `network_interface` blocks attach a network interface to an EC2 Instance during boot time. However, because the network interface is attached at boot-time, replacing/modifying the network interface **WILL** trigger a recreation of the EC2 Instance. If you should need at any point to detach/modify/re-attach a network interface to the instance, use the `aws_network_interface` or `aws_network_interface_attachment` resources instead.

The `network_interface` configuration block _does_, however, allow users to supply their own network interface to be used as the default network interface on an EC2 Instance, attached at `eth0`.

Each `network_interface` block supports the following:

* `delete_on_termination` - (Optional) Whether or not to delete the network interface on instance termination. Defaults to `false`. Currently, the only valid value is `false`, as this is only supported when creating new network interfaces when launching an instance.
* `device_index` - (Required) Integer index of the network interface attachment. Limited by instance type.
* `network_card_index` - (Optional) Integer index of the network card. Limited by instance type. The default index is `0`.
* `network_interface_id` - (Required) ID of the network interface to attach.

### Private DNS Name Options

The `private_dns_name_options` block supports the following:

* `enable_resource_name_dns_aaaa_record` - Indicates whether to respond to DNS queries for instance hostnames with DNS AAAA records.
* `enable_resource_name_dns_a_record` - Indicates whether to respond to DNS queries for instance hostnames with DNS A records.
* `hostname_type` - The type of hostname for Amazon EC2 instances. For IPv4 only subnets, an instance DNS name must be based on the instance IPv4 address. For IPv6 native subnets, an instance DNS name must be based on the instance ID. For dual-stack subnets, you can specify whether DNS names use the instance IPv4 address or the instance ID. Valid values: `ip-name` and `resource-name`.

### Launch Template Specification

-> **Note:** Launch Template parameters will be used only once during instance creation. If you want to update existing instance you need to change parameters
directly. Updating Launch Template specification will force a new instance.

Any other instance parameters that you specify will override the same parameters in the launch template.

The `launch_template` block supports the following:

* `id` - The ID of the launch template. Conflicts with `name`.
* `name` - The name of the launch template. Conflicts with `id`.
* `version` - Template version. Can be a specific version number, `$Latest` or `$Default`. The default value is `$Default`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - The ARN of the instance.
* `capacity_reservation_specification` - Capacity reservation specification of the instance.
* `instance_state` - The state of the instance. One of: `pending`, `running`, `shutting-down`, `terminated`, `stopping`, `stopped`. See [Instance Lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html) for more information.
* `outpost_arn` - The ARN of the Outpost the instance is assigned to.
* `password_data` - Base-64 encoded encrypted password data for the instance. Useful for getting the administrator password for instances running Microsoft Windows. This attribute is only exported if `get_password_data` is true. Note that this encrypted value will be stored in the state file, as with all exported attributes.
