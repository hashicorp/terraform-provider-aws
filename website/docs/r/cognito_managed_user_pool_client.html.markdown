# Resource: aws_cognito_managed_user_pool_client

Use the `aws_cognito_user_pool_client` resource to manage a Cognito User Pool Client.

**This resource is advanced** and has special caveats to consider before use. Please read this document completely before using the resource.

Use the `aws_cognito_managed_user_pool_client` resource to manage a Cognito User Pool Client that is automatically created by an AWS service. For instance, when [configuring an OpenSearch Domain to use Cognito authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/cognito-auth.html), the OpenSearch service creates the User Pool Client during setup and removes it when it is no longer required. As a result, the `aws_cognito_managed_user_pool_client` resource does not create or delete this resource, but instead assumes management of it.

Use the [`aws_cognito_user_pool_client`](cognito_user_pool_client.html) resource to manage Cognito User Pool Clients for normal use cases.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_cognito_managed_user_pool_client" "example" {
  name_prefix  = "AmazonOpenSearchService-example"
  user_pool_id = aws_cognito_user_pool.example.id

  depends_on = [
    aws_opensearch_domain.example,
  ]
}

resource "aws_cognito_user_pool" "example" {
  name = "example"
}

resource "aws_cognito_identity_pool" "example" {
  identity_pool_name = "example"

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [cognito_identity_providers]
  }
}

resource "aws_opensearch_domain" "example" {
  domain_name = "example"

  cognito_options {
    enabled          = true
    user_pool_id     = aws_cognito_user_pool.example.id
    identity_pool_id = aws_cognito_identity_pool.example.id
    role_arn         = aws_iam_role.example.arn
  }

  ebs_options {
    ebs_enabled = true
    volume_size = 10
  }

  depends_on = [
    aws_cognito_user_pool_domain.example,
    aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.example,
  ]
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "example" {
  name               = "example-role"
  path               = "/service-role/"
  assume_role_policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.example.json
}

data "aws_iam_policy_document" "example" {
  statement {
    sid     = ""
    actions = ["sts:AssumeRole"]
    effect  = "Allow"

    principals {
      type = "Service"
      identifiers = [
        "es.${data.aws_partition.current.dns_suffix}",
      ]
    }
  }
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "example" {
  role       = aws_iam_role.example.name
  policy_arn = "arn:${data.aws_partition.current.partition}:iam::aws:policy/AmazonESCognitoAccess"
}

data "aws_partition" "current" {}
```

* `name_prefix` - (Required, one of `name_prefix` or `name_pattern`) String that matches the beginning of the name of the desired User Pool Client. It must match only one User Pool Client.

The following arguments are optional:

* `access_token_validity` - (Optional) Time limit, between 5 minutes and 1 day, after which the access token is no longer valid and cannot be used. By default, the unit is hours. The unit can be overridden by a value in `token_validity_units.access_token`.
* `allowed_oauth_flows_user_pool_client` - (Optional) Whether the client is allowed to use OAuth 2.0 features. `allowed_oauth_flows_user_pool_client` must be set to `true` before you can configure the following arguments: `callback_urls`, `logout_urls`, `allowed_oauth_scopes` and `allowed_oauth_flows`.
* `allowed_oauth_flows` - (Optional) List of allowed OAuth flows, including `code`, `implicit`, and `client_credentials`. `allowed_oauth_flows_user_pool_client` must be set to `true` before you can configure this option.
* `allowed_oauth_scopes` - (Optional) List of allowed OAuth scopes, including `phone`, `email`, `openid`, `profile`, and `aws.cognito.signin.user.admin`. `allowed_oauth_flows_user_pool_client` must be set to `true` before you can configure this option.
* `analytics_configuration` - (Optional) Configuration block for Amazon Pinpoint analytics that collects metrics for this user pool. See [details below](#analytics_configuration).
* `auth_session_validity` - (Optional) Duration, in minutes, of the session token created by Amazon Cognito for each API request in an authentication flow. The session token must be responded to by the native user of the user pool before it expires. Valid values for `auth_session_validity` are between `3` and `15`, with a default value of `3`.
* `callback_urls` - (Optional) List of allowed callback URLs for the identity providers. `allowed_oauth_flows_user_pool_client` must be set to `true` before you can configure this option.
* `default_redirect_uri` - (Optional) Default redirect URI and must be included in the list of callback URLs.
* `enable_token_revocation` - (Optional) Enables or disables token revocation.
* `enable_propagate_additional_user_context_data` - (Optional) Enables the propagation of additional user context data.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `client_secret` - Client secret of the user pool client.
* `id` - Unique identifier for the user pool client.
* `name` - Name of the user pool client.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Cognito User Pool Clients using the `id` of the Cognito User Pool and the `id` of the Cognito User Pool Client. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_cognito_managed_user_pool_client.client
  id = "us-west-2_abc123/3ho4ek12345678909nh3fmhpko"
}
```

Using `terraform import`, import Cognito User Pool Clients using the `id` of the Cognito User Pool and the `id` of the Cognito User Pool Client. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_cognito_managed_user_pool_client.client us-west-2_abc123/3ho4ek12345678909nh3fmhpko
```
