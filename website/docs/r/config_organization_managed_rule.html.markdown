# Resource: aws_config_organization_managed_rule

Manages a Config Organization Managed Rule. More information about these rules can be found in the [Enabling AWS Config Rules Across all Accounts in Your Organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/config-rule-multi-account-deployment.html) and [AWS Config Managed Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config_use-managed-rules.html) documentation. For working with Organization Custom Rules (those invoking a custom Lambda Function), see the [`aws_config_organization_custom_rule` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/config_organization_custom_rule.html).

~> **NOTE:** This resource must be created in the Organization master account and rules will include the master account unless its ID is added to the `excluded_accounts` argument.

~> **NOTE:** Every Organization account except those configured in the `excluded_accounts` argument must have a Configuration Recorder with proper IAM permissions before the rule will successfully create or update. See also the [`aws_config_configuration_recorder` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/config_configuration_recorder.html).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "aws_organizations_organization" "example" {
  aws_service_access_principals = ["config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com"]
  feature_set                   = "ALL"
}

resource "aws_config_organization_managed_rule" "example" {
  depends_on = ["aws_organizations_organization.example"]
