  Manages a RDS Aurora Cluster
---

# Resource: aws_rds_cluster

Manages a [RDS Aurora Cluster][2]. To manage cluster instances that inherit configuration from the cluster (when not running the cluster in `serverless` engine mode), see the [`aws_rds_cluster_instance` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/rds_cluster_instance.html). To manage non-Aurora databases (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.), see the [`aws_db_instance` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/db_instance.html).

For information on the difference between the available Aurora MySQL engines
see [Comparison between Aurora MySQL 1 and Aurora MySQL 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Updates.20180206.html)
in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

Changes to a RDS Cluster can occur when you manually change a
parameter, such as `port`, and are reflected in the next maintenance
window. Because of this, Terraform may report a difference in its planning
phase because a modification has not yet taken place. You can use the
`apply_immediately` flag to instruct the service to apply the change immediately
(see documentation below).

~> **Note:** using `apply_immediately` can result in a
brief downtime as the server reboots. See the AWS Docs on [RDS Maintenance][4]
for more information.

~> **Note:** All arguments including the username and password will be stored in the raw state as plain-text.

### S3 Import Options

Full details on the core parameters and impacts are in the API Docs: [RestoreDBClusterFromS3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_RestoreDBClusterFromS3.html). Requires that the S3 bucket be in the same region as the RDS cluster you're trying to create. Sample:

~> **NOTE:** RDS Aurora Serverless does not support loading data from S3, so its not possible to directly use `engine_mode` set to `serverless` with `s3_import`.

```hcl
resource "aws_rds_cluster" "db" {
  engine = "aurora"

  s3_import {
    source_engine         = "mysql"
    source_engine_version = "5.6"
    bucket_name           = "mybucket"
    bucket_prefix         = "backups"
    ingestion_role        = "arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/role-xtrabackup-rds-restore"
  }
}
```

* `bucket_name` - (Required) The bucket name where your backup is stored
* `bucket_prefix` - (Optional) Can be blank, but is the path to your backup
* `ingestion_role` - (Required) Role applied to load the data.
* `source_engine` - (Required) Source engine for the backup
* `source_engine_version` - (Required) Version of the source engine used to make the backup

This will not recreate the resource if the S3 object changes in some way. It's only used to initialize the database. This only works currently with the aurora engine. See AWS for currently supported engines and options. See [Aurora S3 Migration Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Migrating.ExtMySQL.html#AuroraMySQL.Migrating.ExtMySQL.S3).

### scaling_configuration Argument Reference

~> **NOTE:** `scaling_configuration` configuration is only valid when `engine_mode` is set to `serverless`.

Example:

```hcl
resource "aws_rds_cluster" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  engine_mode = "serverless"

  scaling_configuration {
    auto_pause               = true
    max_capacity             = 256
    min_capacity             = 2
    seconds_until_auto_pause = 300
    timeout_action           = "ForceApplyCapacityChange"
  }
}
```

* `auto_pause` - (Optional) Whether to enable automatic pause. A DB cluster can be paused only when it's idle (it has no connections). If a DB cluster is paused for more than seven days, the DB cluster might be backed up with a snapshot. In this case, the DB cluster is restored when there is a request to connect to it. Defaults to `true`.
* `max_capacity` - (Optional) The maximum capacity. The maximum capacity must be greater than or equal to the minimum capacity. Valid capacity values are `1`, `2`, `4`, `8`, `16`, `32`, `64`, `128`, and `256`. Defaults to `16`.
* `min_capacity` - (Optional) The minimum capacity. The minimum capacity must be lesser than or equal to the maximum capacity. Valid capacity values are `1`, `2`, `4`, `8`, `16`, `32`, `64`, `128`, and `256`. Defaults to `2`.
* `seconds_until_auto_pause` - (Optional) The time, in seconds, before an Aurora DB cluster in serverless mode is paused. Valid values are `300` through `86400`. Defaults to `300`.
* `timeout_action` - (Optional) The action to take when the timeout is reached. Valid values: `ForceApplyCapacityChange`, `RollbackCapacityChange`. Defaults to `RollbackCapacityChange`. See [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.how-it-works.html#aurora-serverless.how-it-works.timeout-action).
