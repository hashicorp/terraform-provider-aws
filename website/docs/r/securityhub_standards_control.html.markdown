# Resource: aws_securityhub_standards_control

Disable/enable Security Hub standards control in the current region.

The `aws_securityhub_standards_control` behaves differently from normal resources, in that
Terraform does not _create_ this resource, but instead "adopts" it
into management. When you _delete_ this resource configuration, Terraform "abandons" resource as is and just removes it from the state.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_securityhub_account" "example" {}

resource "aws_securityhub_standards_subscription" "cis_aws_foundations_benchmark" {
  standards_arn = "arn:aws:securityhub:::ruleset/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark/v/1.2.0"
  depends_on    = [aws_securityhub_account.example]
}

resource "aws_securityhub_standards_control" "ensure_iam_password_policy_prevents_password_reuse" {
  standards_control_arn = "arn:aws:securityhub:us-east-1:111111111111:control/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark/v/1.2.0/1.10"
  control_status        = "DISABLED"
  disabled_reason       = "We handle password policies within Okta"

  depends_on = [aws_securityhub_standards_subscription.cis_aws_foundations_benchmark]
}
```
