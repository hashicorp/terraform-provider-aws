# Resource: aws_organizations_policy_attachment

Provides a resource to attach an AWS Organizations policy to an organization account, root, or unit.

## Example Usage

### Organization Account

```terraform
resource "aws_organizations_policy_attachment" "account" {
  policy_id = aws_organizations_policy.example.id
  target_id = "123456789012"
}
```

### Organization Root

```terraform
resource "aws_organizations_policy_attachment" "root" {
  policy_id = aws_organizations_policy.example.id
  target_id = aws_organizations_organization.example.roots[0].id
}
```

### Organization Unit

```terraform
resource "aws_organizations_policy_attachment" "unit" {
  policy_id = aws_organizations_policy.example.id
  target_id = aws_organizations_organizational_unit.example.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `policy_id` - (Required) The unique identifier (ID) of the policy that you want to attach to the target.
* `target_id` - (Required) The unique identifier (ID) of the root, organizational unit, or account number that you want to attach the policy to.
* `skip_destroy` - (Optional) If set to `true`, destroy will **not** detach the policy and instead just remove the resource from state. This can be useful in situations where the attachment must be preserved to meet the AWS minimum requirement of 1 attached policy.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports no additional attributes.

## Import

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_organizations_policy_attachment.example
  identity = {
    policy_id = "p-12345678"
    target_id = "123456789012"
  }
}

resource "aws_organizations_policy_attachment" "example" {
  ### Configuration omitted for brevity ###
}
```

### Identity Schema

#### Required

* `policy_id` (String) Organizations policy ID.
* `target_id` (String) Organizations target ID (account, OU, or root).

#### Optional

* `account_id` (String) AWS Account where this resource is managed.

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_organizations_policy_attachment` using the target ID and policy ID. For example:

With an account target:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_organizations_policy_attachment.example
  id = "123456789012:p-12345678"
}
```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_organizations_policy_attachment` using the target ID and policy ID. For example:

With an account target:

```console
% terraform import aws_organizations_policy_attachment.example 123456789012:p-12345678
```
