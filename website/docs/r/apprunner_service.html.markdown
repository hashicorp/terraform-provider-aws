## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `service_name` - (Forces new resource) Name of the service.
* `source_configuration` - The source to deploy to the App Runner service. Can be a code or an image repository. See [Source Configuration](#source-configuration) below for more details.

The following arguments are optional:

* `auto_scaling_configuration_arn` - ARN of an App Runner automatic scaling configuration resource that you want to associate with your service. If not provided, App Runner associates the latest revision of a default auto scaling configuration.
* `encryption_configuration` - (Forces new resource) An optional custom encryption key that App Runner uses to encrypt the copy of your source repository that it maintains and your service logs. By default, App Runner uses an AWS managed CMK. See [Encryption Configuration](#encryption-configuration) below for more details.
* `health_check_configuration` - (Forces new resource) Settings of the health check that AWS App Runner performs to monitor the health of your service. See [Health Check Configuration](#health-check-configuration) below for more details.
* `instance_configuration` - The runtime configuration of instances (scaling units) of the App Runner service. See [Instance Configuration](#instance-configuration) below for more details.
* `tags` - Key-value map of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `network_configuration` - Configuration settings related to network traffic of the web application that the App Runner service runs.

### Encryption Configuration

The `encryption_configuration` block supports the following argument:

* `kms_key` - (Required) The ARN of the KMS key used for encryption.

The `source_code_version` block supports the following arguments:

* `type` - (Required) The type of version identifier. For a git-based repository, branches represent versions. Valid values: `BRANCH`.
* `value`- (Required) A source code version. For a git-based repository, a branch name maps to a specific version. App Runner uses the most recent commit to the branch.
