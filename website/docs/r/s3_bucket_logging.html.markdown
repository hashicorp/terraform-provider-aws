# Resource: aws_s3_bucket_logging

Provides an S3 bucket (server access) logging resource. For more information, see [Logging requests using server access logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerLogs.html)
in the AWS S3 User Guide.

~> **Note:** Amazon S3 supports server access logging, AWS CloudTrail, or a combination of both. Refer to the [Logging options for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/logging-with-S3.html)
to decide which method meets your requirements.

-> This resource cannot be used with S3 directory buckets.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-tf-example-bucket"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
  acl    = "private"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "log_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-tf-log-bucket"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "log_bucket_acl" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.log_bucket.id
  acl    = "log-delivery-write"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_logging" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id

  target_bucket = aws_s3_bucket.log_bucket.id
  target_prefix = "log/"
}
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `region` - (Optional) Region where this resource will be [managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints).

* `bucket` - (Required, Forces new resource) Name of the bucket.
* `expected_bucket_owner` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Account ID of the expected bucket owner.
* `target_bucket` - (Required) Name of the bucket where you want Amazon S3 to store server access logs.
* `target_prefix` - (Required) Prefix for all log object keys.
* `target_grant` - (Optional) Set of configuration blocks with information for granting permissions. [See below](#target_grant).
* `target_object_key_format` - (Optional) Amazon S3 key format for log objects. [See below](#target_object_key_format).

### target_grant

The `target_grant` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `grantee` - (Required) Configuration block for the person being granted permissions. [See below](#grantee).

* `partition_date_source` - (Required) Specifies the partition date source for the partitioned prefix. Valid values: `EventTime`, `DeliveryTime`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The `bucket` or `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`) if the latter is provided.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import S3 bucket logging using the `bucket` or using the `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`). For example:

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket is the same account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket`:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_s3_bucket_logging.example
  id = "bucket-name"
}
```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket differs from the account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`):

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_s3_bucket_logging.example
  id = "bucket-name,123456789012"
}
```

**Using `terraform import` to import** S3 bucket logging using the `bucket` or using the `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`). For example:

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket is the same account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket`:

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_logging.example bucket-name
```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket differs from the account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`):

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_logging.example bucket-name,123456789012
```
