# Resource: aws_guardduty_organization_configuration

Manages the GuardDuty Organization Configuration in the current AWS Region. The AWS account utilizing this resource must have been assigned as a delegated Organization administrator account, e.g., via the [`aws_guardduty_organization_admin_account` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/guardduty_organization_admin_account.html). More information about Organizations support in GuardDuty can be found in the [GuardDuty User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_organizations.html).
