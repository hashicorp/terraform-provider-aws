# Resource: aws_api_gateway_base_path_mapping

Connects a custom domain name registered via `aws_api_gateway_domain_name`
with a deployed API so that its methods can be called via the
custom domain name.

## Example Usage

An end-to-end example of a REST API configured with OpenAPI can be found in the [`/examples/api-gateway-rest-api-openapi` directory within the GitHub repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/tree/main/examples/api-gateway-rest-api-openapi).

```terraform
resource "aws_api_gateway_stage" "example" {
  deployment_id = aws_api_gateway_deployment.example.id
  rest_api_id   = aws_api_gateway_rest_api.example.id
  stage_name    = "example"
}

resource "aws_api_gateway_domain_name" "example" {
  domain_name = "example.com"

  certificate_name        = "example-api"
  certificate_body        = file("${path.module}/example.com/example.crt")
  certificate_chain       = file("${path.module}/example.com/ca.crt")
  certificate_private_key = file("${path.module}/example.com/example.key")
}

resource "aws_api_gateway_base_path_mapping" "example" {
  api_id      = aws_api_gateway_rest_api.example.id
  stage_name  = aws_api_gateway_stage.example.stage_name
  domain_name = aws_api_gateway_domain_name.example.domain_name
}
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `domain_name` - (Required) Already-registered domain name to connect the API to.
* `api_id` - (Required) ID of the API to connect.
* `stage_name` - (Optional) Name of a specific deployment stage to expose at the given path. If omitted, callers may select any stage by including its name as a path element after the base path.
* `base_path` - (Optional) Path segment that must be prepended to the path when accessing the API via this mapping. If omitted, the API is exposed at the root of the given domain.
* `domain_name_id` - (Optional) The identifier for the domain name resource. Supported only for private custom domain names.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports no additional attributes.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_api_gateway_base_path_mapping` using the domain name and base path or domain name, base path and domain name ID (for private custom domain names). For example:

For an empty `base_path` or, in other words, a root path (`/`):

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_api_gateway_base_path_mapping.example
  id = "example.com/"
}
```

For a non-root `base_path`:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_api_gateway_base_path_mapping.example
  id = "example.com/base-path"
}
```

For a non-root `base_path` and a private custom domain name:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_api_gateway_base_path_mapping.example
  id = "api.internal.example.com/base-path/abcde12345"
}
```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_api_gateway_base_path_mapping` using the domain name and base path or domain name, base path and domain name ID (for private custom domain names). For example:

For an empty `base_path` or, in other words, a root path (`/`):

```console
% terraform import aws_api_gateway_base_path_mapping.example example.com/
```

For a non-root `base_path`:

```console
% terraform import aws_api_gateway_base_path_mapping.example example.com/base-path
```

For a non-root `base_path` and a private custom domain name:

```console
% terraform import aws_api_gateway_base_path_mapping.example api.internal.example.com/base-path/abcde12345
```
