# Resource: aws_ssm_activation

Registers an on-premises server or virtual machine with Amazon EC2 so that it can be managed using Run Command.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "assume_role" {
  statement {
    effect = "Allow"

    principals {
      type        = "Service"
      identifiers = ["ssm.amazonaws.com"]
    }

    actions = ["sts:AssumeRole"]
  }
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "test_role" {
  name               = "test_role"
  assume_role_policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.assume_role.json
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "test_attach" {
  role       = aws_iam_role.test_role.name
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore"
}

resource "aws_ssm_activation" "foo" {
  name               = "test_ssm_activation"
  description        = "Test"
  iam_role           = aws_iam_role.test_role.id
  registration_limit = "5"
  depends_on         = [aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.test_attach]
}
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `region` - (Optional) Region where this resource will be [managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints). Defaults to the Region set in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#aws-configuration-reference).
* `name` - (Optional) The default name of the registered managed instance.
* `description` - (Optional) The description of the resource that you want to register.
* `expiration_date` - (Optional) UTC timestamp in [RFC3339 format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.8) by which this activation request should expire. The default value is 24 hours from resource creation time. Terraform will only perform drift detection of its value when present in a configuration.
* `iam_role` - (Required) The IAM Role to attach to the managed instance.
* `registration_limit` - (Optional) The maximum number of managed instances you want to register. The default value is 1 instance.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the object. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The activation ID.
* `activation_code` - The code the system generates when it processes the activation.
* `name` - The default name of the registered managed instance.
* `description` - The description of the resource that was registered.
* `expired` - If the current activation has expired.
* `expiration_date` - The date by which this activation request should expire. The default value is 24 hours.
* `iam_role` - The IAM Role attached to the managed instance.
* `registration_limit` - The maximum number of managed instances you want to be registered. The default value is 1 instance.
* `registration_count` - The number of managed instances that are currently registered using this activation.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import AWS SSM Activation using the `id`. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_ssm_activation.example
  id = "e488f2f6-e686-4afb-8a04-ef6dfEXAMPLE"
}
```

Using `terraform import`, import AWS SSM Activation using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_ssm_activation.example e488f2f6-e686-4afb-8a04-ef6dfEXAMPLE
```

-> **Note:** The `activation_code` attribute cannot be imported.
