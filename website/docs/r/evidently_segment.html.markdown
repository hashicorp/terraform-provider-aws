## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `region` - (Optional) Region where this resource will be [managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints).

* `id` - The ID has the same value as the ARN of the segment.
* `last_updated_time` - The date and time that this segment was most recently updated.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import CloudWatch Evidently Segment using the `arn`. For example:

```terraform
import {

  id = "arn:aws:evidently:us-west-2:123456789012:segment/example"
}
```

Using `terraform import`, import CloudWatch Evidently Segment using the `arn`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_evidently_segment.example arn:aws:evidently:us-west-2:123456789012:segment/example
```
