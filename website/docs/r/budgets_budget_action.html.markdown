# Resource: aws_budgets_budget_action

Provides a budget action resource. Budget actions are cost savings controls that run either automatically on your behalf or by using a workflow approval process.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_budgets_budget_action" "example" {
  budget_name        = aws_budgets_budget.example.name
  action_type        = "APPLY_IAM_POLICY"
  approval_model     = "AUTOMATIC"
  notification_type  = "ACTUAL"
  execution_role_arn = aws_iam_role.example.arn

  action_threshold {
    action_threshold_type  = "ABSOLUTE_VALUE"
    action_threshold_value = 100
  }

  definition {
    iam_action_definition {
      policy_arn = aws_iam_policy.example.arn
      roles      = [aws_iam_role.example.name]
    }
  }

  subscriber {
    address           = "example@example.example"
    subscription_type = "EMAIL"
  }
}

resource "aws_iam_policy" "example" {
  name        = "example"
  description = "My example policy"

  policy = <<EOF
{
