# Resource: aws_quicksight_data_source

Resource for managing QuickSight Data Source

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_quicksight_data_source" "default" {

  name           = "My Cool Data in S3"

  parameters {
    s3 {
      manifest_file_location {
        bucket = "my-bucket"
        key    = "path/to/manifest.json"

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the data source

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import a QuickSight data source using the AWS account ID, and data source ID separated by a slash (`/`). For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_quicksight_data_source.example
  id = "123456789123/my-data-source-id"
}
```

Using `terraform import`, import a QuickSight data source using the AWS account ID, and data source ID separated by a slash (`/`). For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_quicksight_data_source.example 123456789123/my-data-source-id
```
