# Resource: aws_kinesis_analytics_application

Provides a Kinesis Analytics Application resource. Kinesis Analytics is a managed service that
allows processing and analyzing streaming data using standard SQL.

For more details, see the [Amazon Kinesis Analytics Documentation][1].

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "aws_kinesis_stream" "test_stream" {
  name        = "terraform-kinesis-test"
  shard_count = 1
}

resource "aws_kinesis_analytics_application" "test_application" {
  name = "kinesis-analytics-application-test"

  inputs {
    name_prefix = "test_prefix"

    kinesis_stream {
      resource_arn = "${aws_kinesis_stream.test_stream.arn}"
      role_arn     = "${aws_iam_role.test.arn}"
    }

    parallelism {
      count = 1
    }

    schema {
      record_columns {
        mapping  = "$.test"
        name     = "test"
        sql_type = "VARCHAR(8)"
      }

      record_encoding = "UTF-8"

      record_format {
        mapping_parameters {
          json {
            record_row_path = "$"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
