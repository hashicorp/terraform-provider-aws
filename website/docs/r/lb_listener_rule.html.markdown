# Resource: aws_lb_listener_rule

Provides a Load Balancer Listener Rule resource.

~> **Note:** `aws_alb_listener_rule` is known as `aws_lb_listener_rule`. The functionality is identical.

## Example Usage

```terraform

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `listener_arn` - (Required, Forces New Resource) The ARN of the listener to which to attach the rule.
* `priority` - (Optional) The priority for the rule between `1` and `50000`. Leaving it unset will automatically set the rule with next available priority after currently existing highest rule. A listener can't have multiple rules with the same priority.

* `value` - (Required) The value of query parameter

### Condition Blocks

One or more condition blocks can be set per rule. Most condition types can only be specified once per rule except for `http-header` and `query-string` which can be specified multiple times.

Condition Blocks (for `condition`) support the following:

* `host_header` - (Optional) Contains a single `values` item which is a list of host header patterns to match. The maximum size of each pattern is 128 characters. Comparison is case insensitive. Wildcard characters supported: * (matches 0 or more characters) and ? (matches exactly 1 character). Only one pattern needs to match for the condition to be satisfied.
* `http_header` - (Optional) HTTP headers to match. [HTTP Header block](#http-header-blocks) fields documented below.
* `http_request_method` - (Optional) Contains a single `values` item which is a list of HTTP request methods or verbs to match. Maximum size is 40 characters. Only allowed characters are A-Z, hyphen (-) and underscore (\_). Comparison is case sensitive. Wildcards are not supported. Only one needs to match for the condition to be satisfied. AWS recommends that GET and HEAD requests are routed in the same way because the response to a HEAD request may be cached.
* `path_pattern` - (Optional) Contains a single `values` item which is a list of path patterns to match against the request URL. Maximum size of each pattern is 128 characters. Comparison is case sensitive. Wildcard characters supported: * (matches 0 or more characters) and ? (matches exactly 1 character). Only one pattern needs to match for the condition to be satisfied. Path pattern is compared only to the path of the URL, not to its query string. To compare against the query string, use a `query_string` condition.
* `query_string` - (Optional) Query strings to match. [Query String block](#query-string-blocks) fields documented below.
* `source_ip` - (Optional) Contains a single `values` item which is a list of source IP CIDR notations to match. You can use both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Wildcards are not supported. Condition is satisfied if the source IP address of the request matches one of the CIDR blocks. Condition is not satisfied by the addresses in the `X-Forwarded-For` header, use `http_header` condition instead.

~> **NOTE::** Exactly one of `host_header`, `http_header`, `http_request_method`, `path_pattern`, `query_string` or `source_ip` must be set per condition.

#### HTTP Header Blocks

HTTP Header Blocks (for `http_header`) support the following:

* `http_header_name` - (Required) Name of HTTP header to search. The maximum size is 40 characters. Comparison is case insensitive. Only RFC7240 characters are supported. Wildcards are not supported. You cannot use HTTP header condition to specify the host header, use a `host-header` condition instead.
* `values` - (Required) List of header value patterns to match. Maximum size of each pattern is 128 characters. Comparison is case insensitive. Wildcard characters supported: * (matches 0 or more characters) and ? (matches exactly 1 character). If the same header appears multiple times in the request they will be searched in order until a match is found. Only one pattern needs to match for the condition to be satisfied. To require that all of the strings are a match, create one condition block per string.

#### Query String Blocks

Query String Blocks (for `query_string`) support the following:

* `values` - (Required) Query string pairs or values to match. Query String Value blocks documented below. Multiple `values` blocks can be specified, see example above. Maximum size of each string is 128 characters. Comparison is case insensitive. Wildcard characters supported: * (matches 0 or more characters) and ? (matches exactly 1 character). To search for a literal '\*' or '?' character in a query string, escape the character with a backslash (\\). Only one pair needs to match for the condition to be satisfied.

Query String Value Blocks (for `query_string.values`) support the following:

* `key` - (Optional) Query string key pattern to match.
* `value` - (Required) Query string value pattern to match.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The ARN of the rule (matches `arn`)
* `arn` - The ARN of the rule (matches `id`)
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import rules using their ARN. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_lb_listener_rule.front_end
  id = "arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:187416307283:listener-rule/app/test/8e4497da625e2d8a/9ab28ade35828f96/67b3d2d36dd7c26b"
}
```

Using `terraform import`, import rules using their ARN. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_lb_listener_rule.front_end arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:187416307283:listener-rule/app/test/8e4497da625e2d8a/9ab28ade35828f96/67b3d2d36dd7c26b
```
