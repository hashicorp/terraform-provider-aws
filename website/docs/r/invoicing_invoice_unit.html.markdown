## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Invoice Units using the ARN. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_invoicing_invoice_unit.example
  id = "arn:aws:invoicing::123456789012:invoice-unit/example-id"
}
```

Using `terraform import`, import Invoice Units using the ARN. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_invoicing_invoice_unit.example arn:aws:invoicing::123456789012:invoice-unit/example-id
```
