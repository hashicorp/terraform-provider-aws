# Resource: aws_transfer_user

Provides a AWS Transfer User resource. Managing SSH keys can be accomplished with the [`aws_transfer_ssh_key` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/transfer_ssh_key.html).


```hcl
resource "aws_transfer_server" "foo" {
  identity_provider_type = "SERVICE_MANAGED"

  tags = {
    NAME = "tf-acc-test-transfer-server"
  }
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "foo" {
  name = "tf-test-transfer-user-iam-role"

  assume_role_policy = <<EOF
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
		"Effect": "Allow",
		"Principal": {
			"Service": "transfer.amazonaws.com"
		},
		"Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
		}
	]
}
EOF
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "foo" {
  name = "tf-test-transfer-user-iam-policy"
  role = "${aws_iam_role.foo.id}"

  policy = <<POLICY
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "AllowFullAccesstoS3",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": [
				"s3:*"
			],
			"Resource": "*"
		}
	]
}
POLICY
}

resource "aws_transfer_user" "foo" {
  server_id = "${aws_transfer_server.foo.id}"
  user_name = "tftestuser"
  role      = "${aws_iam_role.foo.arn}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `server_id` - (Requirement) The Server ID of the Transfer Server (e.g. `s-12345678`)
* `user_name` - (Requirement) The name used for log in to your SFTP server.
* `home_directory` - (Optional) The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the server using their SFTP client.  It should begin with a `/`.  The first item in the path is the name of the home bucket (accessible as `${Transfer:HomeBucket}` in the policy) and the rest is the home directory (accessible as `${Transfer:HomeDirectory}` in the policy). For example, `/example-bucket-1234/username` would set the home bucket to `example-bucket-1234` and the home directory to `username`.
* `policy` - (Optional) An IAM JSON policy document that scopes down user access to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. IAM variables you can use inside this policy include `${Transfer:UserName}`, `${Transfer:HomeDirectory}`, and `${Transfer:HomeBucket}`. Since the IAM variable syntax matches Terraform's interpolation syntax, they must be escaped inside Terraform configuration strings (`$${Transfer:UserName}`).  These are evaluated on-the-fly when navigating the bucket.
* `role` - (Requirement) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that allows the service to controls your user’s access to your Amazon S3 bucket.
* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

## Attributes Reference
In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of Transfer User

## Import

Transfer Users can be imported using the `server_id` and `user_name` separated by `/`.

```
$ terraform import aws_transfer_user.bar s-12345678/test-username
```
