## Example Usage

* `owner_id` - The AWS account ID of the owner of the carrier gateway.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block).
