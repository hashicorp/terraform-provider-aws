### Block devices

Configure additional volumes of the instance besides specified by the AMI. It's a good idea to familiarize yourself with
  [AWS's Block Device Mapping docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/block-device-mapping-concepts.html)
  to understand the implications of using these attributes.

To find out more information for an existing AMI to override the configuration, such as `device_name`, you can use the [AWS CLI ec2 describe-images command](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-images.html).

Each `block_device_mappings` supports the following:

* `device_name` - The name of the device to mount.
* `ebs` - Configure EBS volume properties.
* `no_device` - Suppresses the specified device included in the AMI's block device mapping.
* `virtual_name` - The [Instance Store Device
  Name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html#InstanceStoreDeviceNames)
  (e.g. `"ephemeral0"`).

The `ebs` block supports the following:

* `delete_on_termination` - Whether the volume should be destroyed on instance termination (Default: `true`).
* `encrypted` - Enables [EBS encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html)
  on the volume (Default: `false`). Cannot be used with `snapshot_id`.
* `iops` - The amount of provisioned
  [IOPS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-io-characteristics.html).
  This must be set with a `volume_type` of `"io1"`.
* `kms_key_id` - AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) to use when creating the encrypted volume.
 `encrypted` must be set to `true` when this is set.
* `snapshot_id` - The Snapshot ID to mount.
* `volume_size` - The size of the volume in gigabytes.
* `volume_type` - The type of volume. Can be `"standard"`, `"gp2"`, or `"io1"`. (Default: `"standard"`).

### Credit Specification

Credit specification can be applied/modified to the EC2 Instance at any time.

The `credit_specification` block supports the following:

* `cpu_credits` - The credit option for CPU usage. Can be `"standard"` or `"unlimited"`. (Default: `"standard"`).

The `spot_options` block supports the following:

* `block_duration_minutes` - The required duration in minutes. This value must be a multiple of 60.
* `instance_interruption_behavior` - The behavior when a Spot Instance is interrupted. Can be `hibernate`, 
  `stop`, or `terminate`. (Default: `terminate`).
* `max_price` - The maximum hourly price you're willing to pay for the Spot Instances.
* `spot_instance_type` - The Spot Instance request type. Can be `one-time`, or `persistent`.
