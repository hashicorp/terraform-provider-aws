  Manages a Config Organization Custom Rule

# Resource: aws_config_organization_custom_rule

Manages a Config Organization Custom Rule. More information about these rules can be found in the [Enabling AWS Config Rules Across all Accounts in Your Organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/config-rule-multi-account-deployment.html) and [AWS Config Managed Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config_use-managed-rules.html) documentation. For working with Organization Managed Rules (those invoking an AWS managed rule), see the [`aws_config_organization_managed__rule` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/config_organization_managed_rule.html).

~> **NOTE:** This resource must be created in the Organization master account and rules will include the master account unless its ID is added to the `excluded_accounts` argument.

~> **NOTE:** The proper Lambda permission to allow the AWS Config service invoke the Lambda Function must be in place before the rule will successfully create or update. See also the [`aws_lambda_permission` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/lambda_permission.html).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "aws_lambda_permission" "example" {
  action        = "lambda:InvokeFunction"
  function_name = "${aws_lambda_function.example.arn}"
  principal     = "config.amazonaws.com"
  statement_id  = "AllowExecutionFromConfig"
}

resource "aws_organizations_organization" "example" {
  aws_service_access_principals = ["config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com"]
  feature_set                   = "ALL"
}

resource "aws_config_organization_custom_rule" "example" {
  depends_on = ["aws_lambda_permission.example", "aws_organizations_organization.example"]

  lambda_function_arn = "${aws_lambda_function.example.arn}"
  name                = "example"
  trigger_types       = ["ConfigurationItemChangeNotification"]
}
```
