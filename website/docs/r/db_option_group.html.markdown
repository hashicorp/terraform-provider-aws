# Resource: aws_db_option_group

Provides an RDS DB option group resource. Documentation of the available options for various RDS engines can be found at:

* [MariaDB Options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.MariaDB.Options.html)
* [Microsoft SQL Server Options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.SQLServer.Options.html)
* [MySQL Options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.MySQL.Options.html)
* [Oracle Options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.Oracle.Options.html)

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_db_option_group" "example" {
  name                     = "option-group-test-terraform"
  option_group_description = "Terraform Option Group"
  engine_name              = "sqlserver-ee"
  major_engine_version     = "11.00"

  option {
    option_name = "Timezone"

    option_settings {
      name  = "TIME_ZONE"
      value = "UTC"
    }
  }

  option {
    option_name = "SQLSERVER_BACKUP_RESTORE"

    option_settings {
      name  = "IAM_ROLE_ARN"
      value = aws_iam_role.example.arn
    }
  }

  option {
    option_name = "TDE"
  }
}
```

~> **Note**: Any modifications to the `aws_db_option_group` are set to happen immediately as we default to applying immediately.

~> **WARNING:** You can perform a destroy on a `aws_db_option_group`, as long as it is not associated with any Amazon RDS resource. An option group can be associated with a DB instance, a manual DB snapshot, or an automated DB snapshot.

If you try to delete an option group that is associated with an Amazon RDS resource, an error similar to the following is returned:

> An error occurred (InvalidOptionGroupStateFault) when calling the DeleteOptionGroup operation: The option group 'optionGroupName' cannot be deleted because it is in use.

More information about this can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.html#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.Delete).

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Optional, Forces new resource) The name of the option group. If omitted, Terraform will assign a random, unique name. Must be lowercase, to match as it is stored in AWS.
* `name_prefix` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Creates a unique name beginning with the specified prefix. Conflicts with `name`. Must be lowercase, to match as it is stored in AWS.

* `port` - (Optional) The Port number when connecting to the Option (e.g., 11211).
