Manages an Image Builder Image Recipe.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_imagebuilder_image_recipe" "example" {
  block_device_mapping {
    device_name = "/dev/xvdb"

    ebs {
      delete_on_termination = true
      volume_size           = 100
      volume_type           = "gp2"
    }
  }

  component {
    component_arn = aws_imagebuilder_component.example.arn
  }

  name         = "example"
  parent_image = "arn:${data.aws_partition.current.partition}:imagebuilder:${data.aws_region.current.name}:aws:image/amazon-linux-2-x86/x.x.x"
  version      = "1.0.0"
}
```

#### ebs

The following arguments are optional:

* `delete_on_termination` - (Optional) Whether to delete the volume on termination. Defaults to unset, which is the value inherited from the parent image.
* `encrypted` - (Optional) Whether to encrypt the volume. Defaults to unset, which is the value inherited from the parent image.
