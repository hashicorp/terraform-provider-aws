# Resource: aws_imagebuilder_image_recipe

Manages an Image Builder Image Recipe.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_imagebuilder_image_recipe" "example" {
  block_device_mapping {
    device_name = "/dev/xvdb"

    ebs {
      delete_on_termination = true
      volume_size           = 100
      volume_type           = "gp2"
    }
  }

  component {
    component_arn = aws_imagebuilder_component.example.arn

    parameter {
      name  = "Parameter1"
      value = "Value1"
    }

    parameter {
      name  = "Parameter2"
      value = "Value2"
    }
  }

  name         = "example"
  parent_image = "arn:${data.aws_partition.current.partition}:imagebuilder:${data.aws_region.current.name}:aws:image/amazon-linux-2-x86/x.x.x"
  version      = "1.0.0"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `component` - (Required) Ordered configuration block(s) with components for the image recipe. Detailed below.
* `name` - (Required) Name of the image recipe.
* `parent_image` - (Required) The image recipe uses this image as a base from which to build your customized image. The value can be the base image ARN or an AMI ID.
* `version` - (Required) The semantic version of the image recipe, which specifies the version in the following format, with numeric values in each position to indicate a specific version: major.minor.patch. For example: 1.0.0.

The following attributes are optional:

* `block_device_mapping` - (Optional) Configuration block(s) with block device mappings for the image recipe. Detailed below.
* `description` - (Optional) Description of the image recipe.
* `systems_manager_agent` - (Optional) Configuration block for the Systems Manager Agent installed by default by Image Builder. Detailed below.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags for the image recipe. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `user_data_base64` - (Optional) Base64 encoded user data. Use this to provide commands or a command script to run when you launch your build instance.
* `working_directory` - (Optional) The working directory to be used during build and test workflows.

### `block_device_mapping`

* `device_name` - (Optional) Name of the device. For example, `/dev/sda` or `/dev/xvdb`.
* `ebs` - (Optional) Configuration block with Elastic Block Storage (EBS) block device mapping settings. Detailed below.
* `no_device` - (Optional) Set to `true` to remove a mapping from the parent image.
* `virtual_name` - (Optional) Virtual device name. For example, `ephemeral0`. Instance store volumes are numbered starting from 0.

#### `ebs`

* `delete_on_termination` - (Optional) Whether to delete the volume on termination. Defaults to unset, which is the value inherited from the parent image.
* `encrypted` - (Optional) Whether to encrypt the volume. Defaults to unset, which is the value inherited from the parent image.
* `iops` - (Optional) Number of Input/Output (I/O) operations per second to provision for an `io1` or `io2` volume.
* `kms_key_id` - (Optional) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Key Management Service (KMS) Key for encryption.
* `snapshot_id` - (Optional) Identifier of the EC2 Volume Snapshot.
* `throughput` - (Optional) For GP3 volumes only. The throughput in MiB/s that the volume supports.
* `volume_size` - (Optional) Size of the volume, in GiB.
* `volume_type` - (Optional) Type of the volume. For example, `gp2` or `io2`.

### `component`

* `component_arn` - (Required) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Image Builder Component to associate.
* `parameter` - (Optional) Configuration block(s) for parameters to configure the component. Detailed below.

### `parameter`

* `name` - (Required) The name of the component parameter.
* `value` - (Required) The value for the named component parameter.

### `systems_manager_agent`

* `uninstall_after_build` - (Required) Whether to remove the Systems Manager Agent after the image has been built.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image recipe.
* `date_created` - Date the image recipe was created.
* `owner` - Owner of the image recipe.
* `platform` - Platform of the image recipe.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_imagebuilder_image_recipe` resources using the Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_imagebuilder_image_recipe.example
  id = "arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-east-1:123456789012:image-recipe/example/1.0.0"
}
```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_imagebuilder_image_recipe` resources using the Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_imagebuilder_image_recipe.example arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-east-1:123456789012:image-recipe/example/1.0.0
```
