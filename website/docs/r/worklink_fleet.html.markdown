## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import WorkLink using the ARN. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_worklink_fleet.test
  id = "arn:aws:worklink::123456789012:fleet/example"
}
```

Using `terraform import`, import WorkLink using the ARN. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_worklink_fleet.test arn:aws:worklink::123456789012:fleet/example
```
