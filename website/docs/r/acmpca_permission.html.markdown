# Resource: aws_acmpca_permission

Provides a resource to manage an AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authorities Permission.
Currently, this is only required in order to allow the ACM service to automatically renew certificates issued by a PCA.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_acmpca_permission" "example" {
  certificate_authority_arn = aws_acmpca_certificate_authority.example.arn
  actions                   = ["IssueCertificate", "GetCertificate", "ListPermissions"]
  principal                 = "acm.amazonaws.com"
}

resource "aws_acmpca_certificate_authority" "example" {
  certificate_authority_configuration {
    key_algorithm     = "RSA_4096"
    signing_algorithm = "SHA512WITHRSA"

    subject {
      common_name = "example.com"
    }
  }
}
```
