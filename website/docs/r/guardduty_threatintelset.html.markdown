# Resource: aws_guardduty_threatintelset

Provides a resource to manage a GuardDuty ThreatIntelSet.

~> **Note:** Currently in GuardDuty, users from member accounts cannot upload and further manage ThreatIntelSets. ThreatIntelSets that are uploaded by the primary account are imposed on GuardDuty functionality in its member accounts. See the [GuardDuty API Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/create-threat-intel-set.html)

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_guardduty_detector" "primary" {
  enable = true
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  acl = "private"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_object" "MyThreatIntelSet" {
  acl     = "public-read"
  content = "10.0.0.0/8\n"
  bucket  = aws_s3_bucket.bucket.id
  key     = "MyThreatIntelSet"
}

resource "aws_guardduty_threatintelset" "MyThreatIntelSet" {
  activate    = true
  detector_id = aws_guardduty_detector.primary.id
  format      = "TXT"
  location    = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/${aws_s3_bucket_object.MyThreatIntelSet.bucket}/${aws_s3_bucket_object.MyThreatIntelSet.key}"
  name        = "MyThreatIntelSet"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `activate` - (Required) Specifies whether GuardDuty is to start using the uploaded ThreatIntelSet.
* `detector_id` - (Required) The detector ID of the GuardDuty.
* `format` - (Required) The format of the file that contains the ThreatIntelSet. Valid values: `TXT` | `STIX` | `OTX_CSV` | `ALIEN_VAULT` | `PROOF_POINT` | `FIRE_EYE`
* `location` - (Required) The URI of the file that contains the ThreatIntelSet.

* `arn` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the GuardDuty ThreatIntelSet.
* `id` - The ID of the GuardDuty ThreatIntelSet and the detector ID. Format: `<DetectorID>:<ThreatIntelSetID>`
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block).
