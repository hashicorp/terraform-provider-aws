## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import DataZone Environment using the `domain_identifier,id`. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_datazone_environment.example
  id = "dzd_d2i7tzk3tnjjf4,5vpywijpwryec0"
}
```

Using `terraform import`, import DataZone Environment using the `domain_idntifier,id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_datazone_environment.example dzd_d2i7tzk3tnjjf4,5vpywijpwryec0
```
