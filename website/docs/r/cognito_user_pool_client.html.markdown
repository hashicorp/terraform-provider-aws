# Resource: aws_cognito_user_pool_client

Provides a Cognito User Pool Client resource.

To manage a User Pool Client created by another service, such as when [configuring an OpenSearch Domain to use Cognito authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/cognito-auth.html),
use the [`aws_cognito_managed_user_pool_client` resource](cognito_managed_user_pool_client.html) instead.

## Example Usage

### Create a basic user pool client

```terraform
resource "aws_cognito_user_pool_client" "client" {
  name = "client"

  user_pool_id = aws_cognito_user_pool.pool.id
}

resource "aws_cognito_user_pool" "pool" {
  name = "pool"
}
```

### Create a user pool client with no SRP authentication

```terraform
resource "aws_cognito_user_pool_client" "client" {
  name = "client"

  user_pool_id = aws_cognito_user_pool.pool.id

  generate_secret     = true
  explicit_auth_flows = ["ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH"]
}

resource "aws_cognito_user_pool" "pool" {
  name = "pool"
}
```

### Create a user pool client with pinpoint analytics

```terraform
resource "aws_cognito_user_pool_client" "test" {
  name         = "pool_client"
  user_pool_id = aws_cognito_user_pool.test.id

  analytics_configuration {
    application_id   = aws_pinpoint_app.test.application_id
    external_id      = "some_id"
    role_arn         = aws_iam_role.test.arn
    user_data_shared = true
  }
}

resource "aws_cognito_user_pool" "test" {
  name = "pool"
}

data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

resource "aws_pinpoint_app" "test" {
  name = "pinpoint"
}

data "aws_iam_policy_document" "assume_role" {
  statement {
    effect = "Allow"

    principals {
      type        = "Service"
      identifiers = ["cognito-idp.amazonaws.com"]
    }

    actions = ["sts:AssumeRole"]
  }
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "test" {
  name               = "role"
  assume_role_policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.assume_role.json
}

data "aws_iam_policy_document" "test" {
  statement {
    effect = "Allow"

    actions = [
      "mobiletargeting:UpdateEndpoint",
      "mobiletargeting:PutEvents",
    ]

    resources = ["arn:aws:mobiletargeting:*:${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}:apps/${aws_pinpoint_app.test.application_id}*"]
  }
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "test" {
  name   = "role_policy"
  role   = aws_iam_role.test.id
  policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.test.json
}
```

### Create a user pool client with Cognito as the identity provider

```terraform
resource "aws_cognito_user_pool_client" "userpool_client" {
  name                                 = "client"
  user_pool_id                         = aws_cognito_user_pool.pool.id
  callback_urls                        = ["https://example.com"]
  allowed_oauth_flows_user_pool_client = true
  allowed_oauth_flows                  = ["code", "implicit"]
  allowed_oauth_scopes                 = ["email", "openid"]
  supported_identity_providers         = ["COGNITO"]
}

resource "aws_cognito_user_pool" "pool" {
  name = "pool"
}
```

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `client_secret` - Client secret of the user pool client.
* `id` - ID of the user pool client.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Cognito User Pool Clients using the `id` of the Cognito User Pool, and the `id` of the Cognito User Pool Client. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_cognito_user_pool_client.client
  id = "us-west-2_abc123/3ho4ek12345678909nh3fmhpko"
}
```

Using `terraform import`, import Cognito User Pool Clients using the `id` of the Cognito User Pool, and the `id` of the Cognito User Pool Client. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_cognito_user_pool_client.client us-west-2_abc123/3ho4ek12345678909nh3fmhpko
```
