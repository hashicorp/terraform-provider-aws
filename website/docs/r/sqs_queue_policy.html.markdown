## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import SQS Queue Policies using the queue URL. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_sqs_queue_policy.test
  id = "https://queue.amazonaws.com/123456789012/myqueue"
}
```

Using `terraform import`, import SQS Queue Policies using the queue URL. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_sqs_queue_policy.test https://queue.amazonaws.com/123456789012/myqueue
```
