# Resource: aws_vpn_connection

Manages a Site-to-Site VPN connection. A Site-to-Site VPN connection is an Internet Protocol security (IPsec) VPN connection between a VPC and an on-premises network.
Any new Site-to-Site VPN connection that you create is an [AWS VPN connection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/vpn-categories.html).

~> **Note:** All arguments including `tunnel1_preshared_key` and `tunnel2_preshared_key` will be stored in the raw state as plain-text.
[Read more about sensitive data in state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).

~> **Note:** The CIDR blocks in the arguments `tunnel1_inside_cidr` and `tunnel2_inside_cidr` must have a prefix of /30 and be a part of a specific range.
[Read more about this in the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_VpnTunnelOptionsSpecification.html).

## Example Usage
