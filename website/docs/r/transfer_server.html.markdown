## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `endpoint_details` - (Optional) The virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that you want to configure for your SFTP server. Fields documented below.
* `endpoint_type` - (Optional) The type of endpoint that you want your SFTP server connect to. If you connect to a `VPC_ENDPOINT`, your SFTP server isn't accessible over the public internet. If you want to connect your SFTP server via public internet, set `PUBLIC`.
* `invocation_role` - (Optional) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role used to authenticate the user account with an `identity_provider_type` of `API_GATEWAY`.
* `url` - (Optional) - URL of the service endpoint used to authenticate users with an `identity_provider_type` of `API_GATEWAY`.
* `identity_provider_type` - (Optional) The mode of authentication enabled for this service. The default value is `SERVICE_MANAGED`, which allows you to store and access SFTP user credentials within the service. `API_GATEWAY` indicates that user authentication requires a call to an API Gateway endpoint URL provided by you to integrate an identity provider of your choice.
* `logging_role` - (Optional) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that allows the service to write your SFTP users’ activity to your Amazon CloudWatch logs for monitoring and auditing purposes.
* `force_destroy` - (Optional) A boolean that indicates all users associated with the server should be deleted so that the Server can be destroyed without error. The default value is `false`.
* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

**endpoint_details** requires the following:

* `vpc_endpoint_id` - (Required) The ID of the VPC endpoint.

## Attributes Reference
In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of Transfer Server
* `id`  - The Server ID of the Transfer Server (e.g. `s-12345678`)
* `endpoint` - The endpoint of the Transfer Server (e.g. `s-12345678.server.transfer.REGION.amazonaws.com`)

## Import

Transfer Servers can be imported using the `server id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import aws_transfer_server.bar s-12345678
```
