  Manages accepting a Resource Access Manager (RAM) Resource Share invitation.

# Resource: aws_ram_resource_share_accepter

Manage accepting a Resource Access Manager (RAM) Resource Share invitation. From a _receiver_ AWS account, accept an invitation to share resources that were shared by a _sender_ AWS account. To create a resource share in the _sender_, see the [`aws_ram_resource_share` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/ram_resource_share.html).

~> **Note:** If both AWS accounts are in the same Organization and [RAM Sharing with AWS Organizations is enabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/getting-started-sharing.html#getting-started-sharing-orgs), this resource is not necessary as RAM Resource Share invitations are not used.

## Example Usage

This configuration provides an example of using multiple Terraform AWS providers to configure two different AWS accounts. In the _sender_ account, the configuration creates a `aws_ram_resource_share` and uses a data source in the _receiver_ account to create a `aws_ram_principal_association` resource with the _receiver's_ account ID. In the _receiver_ account, the configuration accepts the invitation to share resources with the `aws_ram_resource_share_accepter`.

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  profile = "profile2"
}

provider "aws" {
  alias   = "alternate"
  profile = "profile1"
}

resource "aws_ram_resource_share" "sender_share" {
  provider = "aws.alternate"

  name                      = "tf-test-resource-share"
  allow_external_principals = true

  tags = {
	  Name = "tf-test-resource-share"
  }
}

resource "aws_ram_principal_association" "sender_invite" {
  provider = "aws.alternate"

  principal          = "${data.aws_caller_identity.receiver.account_id}"
  resource_share_arn = "${aws_ram_resource_share.test.arn}"
}

data "aws_caller_identity" "receiver" {}

resource "aws_ram_resource_share_accepter" "receiver_accept" {
  share_arn = "${aws_ram_principal_association.test.resource_share_arn}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `share_arn` - (Required) The ARN of the resource share.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `invitation_arn` - The ARN of the resource share invitation.
* `share_id` - The ID of the resource share as displayed in the console.
* `status` - The status of the invitation (e.g., ACCEPTED, REJECTED).
* `receiver_account_id` - The account ID of the receiver account which accepts the invitation.
* `sender_account_id` - The account ID of the sender account which extends the invitation.
* `share_name` - The name of the resource share.
* `resources` - A list of the resource ARNs shared via the resource share.

## Import

Resource share accepters can be imported using the resource share ARN, e.g.

```
$ terraform import aws_ram_resource_share_accepter.example arn:aws:ram:us-east-1:123456789012:resource-share/c4b56393-e8d9-89d9-6dc9-883752de4767
```
