# Resource: aws_osis_pipeline

Terraform resource for managing an AWS OpenSearch Ingestion Pipeline.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```terraform
data "aws_region" "current" {}

resource "aws_iam_role" "example" {
  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
        Effect = "Allow"
        Sid    = ""
        Principal = {
          Service = "osis-pipelines.amazonaws.com"
        }
      },
    ]
  })
}

resource "aws_osis_pipeline" "example" {
  pipeline_name               = "example"
  pipeline_configuration_body = <<-EOT
            version: "2"
            example-pipeline:
              source:
                http:
                  path: "/example"
              sink:
                - s3:
                    aws:
                      sts_role_arn: "${aws_iam_role.example.arn}"
                      region: "${data.aws_region.current.name}"
                    bucket: "example"
                    threshold:
                      event_collect_timeout: "60s"
                    codec:
                      ndjson:
        EOT
  max_units                   = 1
  min_units                   = 1
}
```

### Using file function

```terraform
resource "aws_osis_pipeline" "example" {
  pipeline_name               = "example"
  pipeline_configuration_body = file("example.yaml")
  max_units                   = 1
  min_units                   = 1
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `max_units` - (Required) The maximum pipeline capacity, in Ingestion Compute Units (ICUs).
* `min_units` - (Required) The minimum pipeline capacity, in Ingestion Compute Units (ICUs).
* `pipeline_configuration_body` - (Required) The pipeline configuration in YAML format. This argument accepts the pipeline configuration as a string or within a .yaml file. If you provide the configuration as a string, each new line must be escaped with \n.
* `pipeline_name` - (Required) The name of the OpenSearch Ingestion pipeline to create. Pipeline names are unique across the pipelines owned by an account within an AWS Region.

The following arguments are optional:

* `buffer_options` - (Optional) Key-value pairs to configure persistent buffering for the pipeline. See [`buffer_options`](#buffer_options) below.
* `encryption_at_rest_options` - (Optional) Key-value pairs to configure encryption for data that is written to a persistent buffer. See [`encryption_at_rest_options`](#encryption_at_rest_options) below.
* `log_publishing_options` - (Optional) Key-value pairs to configure log publishing. See [`log_publishing_options`](#log_publishing_options) below.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the pipeline. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `vpc_options` - (Optional) Container for the values required to configure VPC access for the pipeline. If you don't specify these values, OpenSearch Ingestion creates the pipeline with a public endpoint. See [`vpc_options`](#vpc_options) below.

### buffer_options

* `persistent_buffer_enabled` - (Required) Whether persistent buffering should be enabled.

### encryption_at_rest_options

* `kms_key_arn` - (Required) The ARN of the KMS key used to encrypt data-at-rest in OpenSearch Ingestion. By default, data is encrypted using an AWS owned key.

### log_publishing_options

* `cloudwatch_log_destination` - (Optional) The destination for OpenSearch Ingestion logs sent to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. This parameter is required if IsLoggingEnabled is set to true. See [`cloudwatch_log_destination`](#cloudwatch_log_destination) below.
* `is_logging_enabled` - (Optional) Whether logs should be published.

### cloudwatch_log_destination

* `log_group` - (Required) The name of the CloudWatch Logs group to send pipeline logs to. You can specify an existing log group or create a new one. For example, /aws/OpenSearchService/IngestionService/my-pipeline.

### vpc_options

* `subnet_ids` - (Required) A list of subnet IDs associated with the VPC endpoint.
* `security_group_ids` - (Optional) A list of security groups associated with the VPC endpoint.
* `vpc_endpoint_management` - (Optional) Whether you or Amazon OpenSearch Ingestion service create and manage the VPC endpoint configured for the pipeline. Valid values are `CUSTOMER` or `SERVICE`

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - Unique identifier for the pipeline.
* `ingest_endpoint_urls` - The list of ingestion endpoints for the pipeline, which you can send data to.
* `pipeline_arn` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the pipeline.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `create` - (Default `45m`)
* `update` - (Default `45m`)
* `delete` - (Default `45m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import OpenSearch Ingestion Pipeline using the `id`. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_osis_pipeline.example
  id = "example"
}
```

Using `terraform import`, import OpenSearch Ingestion Pipeline using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_osis_pipeline.example example
```
