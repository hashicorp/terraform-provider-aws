# Resource: aws_servicecatalog_portfolio_share

Manages a Service Catalog Portfolio Share. Shares the specified portfolio with the specified account or organization node. You can share portfolios to an organization, an organizational unit, or a specific account.

If the portfolio share with the specified account or organization node already exists, using this resource to re-create the share will have no effect and will not return an error. You can then use this resource to update the share.

~> **NOTE:** Shares to an organization node can only be created by the management account of an organization or by a delegated administrator. If a delegated admin is de-registered, they can no longer create portfolio shares.

~> **NOTE:** AWSOrganizationsAccess must be enabled in order to create a portfolio share to an organization node.

~> **NOTE:** You can't share a shared resource, including portfolios that contain a shared product.
