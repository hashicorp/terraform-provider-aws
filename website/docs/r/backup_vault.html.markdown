# Resource: aws_backup_vault

Provides an AWS Backup vault resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_backup_vault" "example" {
  name        = "example_backup_vault"

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The name of the vault.
* `arn` - The ARN of the vault.
* `recovery_points` - The number of recovery points that are stored in a backup vault.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

Backup vault can be imported using the `name`, e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_backup_vault.test-vault TestVault
```
