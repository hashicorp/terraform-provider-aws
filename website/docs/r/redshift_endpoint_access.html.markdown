  cluster_identifier = aws_redshift_cluster.example.cluster_identifier
}
```

* `address` - The DNS address of the endpoint.
* `id` - The Redshift-managed VPC endpoint name.
* `port` - The port number on which the cluster accepts incoming connections.
* `vpc_endpoint` - The connection endpoint for connecting to an Amazon Redshift cluster through the proxy. See details below.

### VPC Endpoint

* `network_interface` - One or more network interfaces of the endpoint. Also known as an interface endpoint. See details below.
* `vpc_endpoint_id` - The connection endpoint ID for connecting an Amazon Redshift cluster through the proxy.
* `vpc_id` - The VPC identifier that the endpoint is associated.

### Network Interface

* `availability_zone` - The Availability Zone.
* `network_interface_id` - The network interface identifier.
* `private_ip_address` - The IPv4 address of the network interface within the subnet.
* `subnet_id` - The subnet identifier.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Redshift endpoint access using the `name`. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_redshift_endpoint_access.example
  id = "example"
}
```

Using `terraform import`, import Redshift endpoint access using the `name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_redshift_endpoint_access.example example
```
