# Resource: aws_service_discovery_service

Provides a Service Discovery Service resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_vpc" "example" {
  cidr_block           = "10.0.0.0/16"
  enable_dns_support   = true
  enable_dns_hostnames = true
}

resource "aws_service_discovery_private_dns_namespace" "example" {
  name        = "example.terraform.local"
  description = "example"
  vpc         = aws_vpc.example.id
}

resource "aws_service_discovery_service" "example" {
  name = "example"

  dns_config {
    namespace_id = aws_service_discovery_private_dns_namespace.example.id

    dns_records {
      ttl  = 10
      type = "A"
    }

    routing_policy = "MULTIVALUE"
  }

  health_check_custom_config {
    failure_threshold = 1
  }
}
```

```terraform
resource "aws_service_discovery_public_dns_namespace" "example" {
  name        = "example.terraform.com"
  description = "example"
}

resource "aws_service_discovery_service" "example" {
  name = "example"

  dns_config {
    namespace_id = aws_service_discovery_public_dns_namespace.example.id

    dns_records {
      ttl  = 10
      type = "A"
    }
  }

  health_check_config {
    failure_threshold = 10
    resource_path     = "path"
    type              = "HTTP"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required, Forces new resource) The name of the service.
* `description` - (Optional) The description of the service.
* `dns_config` - (Optional) A complex type that contains information about the resource record sets that you want Amazon Route 53 to create when you register an instance. See [`dns_config` Block](#dns_config-block) for details.
* `health_check_config` - (Optional) A complex type that contains settings for an optional health check. Only for Public DNS namespaces. See [`health_check_config` Block](#health_check_config-block) for details.
* `force_destroy` - (Optional) A boolean that indicates all instances should be deleted from the service so that the service can be destroyed without error. These instances are not recoverable. Defaults to `false`.
* `health_check_custom_config` - (Optional, Forces new resource) A complex type that contains settings for ECS managed health checks. See [`health_check_custom_config` Block](#health_check_custom_config-block) for details.
* `namespace_id` - (Optional) The ID of the namespace that you want to use to create the service.
* `type` - (Optional) If present, specifies that the service instances are only discoverable using the `DiscoverInstances` API operation. No DNS records is registered for the service instances. The only valid value is `HTTP`.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the service. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

### `dns_config` Block

The `dns_config` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `namespace_id` - (Required, Forces new resource) The ID of the namespace to use for DNS configuration.
* `dns_records` - (Required) An array that contains one DnsRecord object for each resource record set. See [`dns_records` Block](#dns_records-block) for details.
* `routing_policy` - (Optional) The routing policy that you want to apply to all records that Route 53 creates when you register an instance and specify the service. Valid Values: MULTIVALUE, WEIGHTED

#### `dns_records` Block

The `dns_records` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `ttl` - (Required) The amount of time, in seconds, that you want DNS resolvers to cache the settings for this resource record set.
* `type` - (Required, Forces new resource) The type of the resource, which indicates the value that Amazon Route 53 returns in response to DNS queries. Valid Values: A, AAAA, SRV, CNAME

### `health_check_config` Block

The `health_check_config` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `failure_threshold` - (Optional) The number of consecutive health checks. Maximum value of 10.
* `resource_path` - (Optional) The path that you want Route 53 to request when performing health checks. Route 53 automatically adds the DNS name for the service. If you don't specify a value, the default value is /.
* `type` - (Optional, Forces new resource) The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Route 53 determines whether an endpoint is healthy. Valid Values: HTTP, HTTPS, TCP

### `health_check_custom_config` Block

The `health_check_custom_config` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `failure_threshold` - (Optional, Forces new resource) The number of 30-second intervals that you want service discovery to wait before it changes the health status of a service instance.  Maximum value of 10.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The ID of the service.
* `arn` - The ARN of the service.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Service Discovery Service using the service ID. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_service_discovery_service.example
  id = "0123456789"
}
```

Using `terraform import`, import Service Discovery Service using the service ID. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_service_discovery_service.example 0123456789
```
