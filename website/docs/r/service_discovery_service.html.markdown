## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "aws_vpc" "example" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

resource "aws_service_discovery_private_dns_namespace" "example" {
  name = "example.terraform.local"
  description = "example"
  vpc = "${aws_vpc.example.id}"
}

resource "aws_service_discovery_service" "example" {
  name = "example"
  dns_config {
    namespace_id = "${aws_service_discovery_private_dns_namespace.example.id}"
    dns_records {
      ttl = 10
      type = "A"
    }
  }
}
```

```hcl
resource "aws_service_discovery_public_dns_namespace" "example" {
  name = "example.terraform.com"
  description = "example"
}

resource "aws_service_discovery_service" "example" {
  name = "example"
  dns_config {
    namespace_id = "${aws_service_discovery_public_dns_namespace.example.id}"
    dns_records {
      ttl = 10
      type = "A"
    }
  }
  health_check_config {
    failure_threshold = 100
    resource_path = "path"
    type = "HTTP"
  }
}
```
