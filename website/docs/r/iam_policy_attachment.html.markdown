# Resource: aws_iam_policy_attachment

Attaches a Managed IAM Policy to user(s), role(s), and/or group(s)

!> **WARNING:** The aws_iam_policy_attachment resource creates **exclusive** attachments of IAM policies. Across the entire AWS account, all of the users/roles/groups to which a single policy is attached must be declared by a single aws_iam_policy_attachment resource. This means that even any users/roles/groups that have the attached policy via any other mechanism (including other Terraform resources) will have that attached policy revoked by this resource. Consider `aws_iam_role_policy_attachment`, `aws_iam_user_policy_attachment`, or `aws_iam_group_policy_attachment` instead. These resources do not enforce exclusive attachment of an IAM policy.

~> **NOTE:** The usage of this resource conflicts with the `aws_iam_group_policy_attachment`, `aws_iam_role_policy_attachment`, and `aws_iam_user_policy_attachment` resources and will permanently show a difference if both are defined.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "aws_iam_user" "user" {
  name = "test-user"
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "role" {
  name = "test-role"

  assume_role_policy = <<EOF
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Sid": ""
    }
  ]
}
EOF
}

resource "aws_iam_group" "group" {
  name = "test-group"
}

resource "aws_iam_policy" "policy" {
  name        = "test-policy"
  description = "A test policy"

  policy = <<EOF
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "ec2:Describe*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

  name       = "test-attachment"
  users      = ["${aws_iam_user.user.name}"]
  roles      = ["${aws_iam_role.role.name}"]
  groups     = ["${aws_iam_group.group.name}"]
  policy_arn = "${aws_iam_policy.policy.arn}"
}
```
