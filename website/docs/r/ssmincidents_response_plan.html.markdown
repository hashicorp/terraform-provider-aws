# Resource: aws_ssmincidents_response_plan

Provides a Terraform resource to manage response plans in AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager.

~> NOTE: A response plan implicitly depends on a replication set. If you configured your replication set in Terraform, we recommend you add it to the `depends_on` argument for the Terraform ResponsePlan Resource.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_ssmincidents_response_plan" "example" {
  name = "name"

  incident_template {
    title  = "title"
    impact = "3"
  }

  tags = {
    key = "value"
  }

  depends_on = [aws_ssmincidents_replication_set.example]
}

```

### Usage With All Fields

```terraform
resource "aws_ssmincidents_response_plan" "example" {
  name = "name"

  incident_template {
    title         = "title"
    impact        = "3"
    dedupe_string = "dedupe"
    incident_tags = {
      key = "value"
    }

    notification_target {
      sns_topic_arn = aws_sns_topic.example1.arn
    }

    notification_target {
      sns_topic_arn = aws_sns_topic.example2.arn
    }

    summary = "summary"
  }

  display_name = "display name"
  chat_channel = [aws_sns_topic.topic.arn]
  engagements  = ["arn:aws:ssm-contacts:us-east-2:111122223333:contact/test1"]

  action {
    ssm_automation {
      document_name    = aws_ssm_document.document1.name
      role_arn         = aws_iam_role.role1.arn
      document_version = "version1"
      target_account   = "RESPONSE_PLAN_OWNER_ACCOUNT"
      parameter {
        name   = "key"
        values = ["value1", "value2"]
      }
      parameter {
        name   = "foo"
        values = ["bar"]
      }
      dynamic_parameters = {
        someKey    = "INVOLVED_RESOURCES"
        anotherKey = "INCIDENT_RECORD_ARN"
      }
    }
  }

  integration {
    pagerduty {
      name       = "pagerdutyIntergration"
      service_id = "example"
      secret_id  = "example"
    }
  }

  tags = {
    key = "value"
  }

  depends_on = [aws_ssmincidents_replication_set.example]
}

```

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - The ARN of the response plan.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import an Incident Manager response plan using the response plan ARN. You can find the response plan ARN in the AWS Management Console. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_ssmincidents_response_plan.responsePlanName
  id = "ARNValue"
}
```

Using `terraform import`, import an Incident Manager response plan using the response plan ARN. You can find the response plan ARN in the AWS Management Console. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_ssmincidents_response_plan.responsePlanName ARNValue
```
