## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import bot aliases using an ID with the format `bot_name:bot_alias_name`. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_lex_bot_alias.order_flowers_prod
  id = "OrderFlowers:OrderFlowersProd"
}
```

Using `terraform import`, import bot aliases using an ID with the format `bot_name:bot_alias_name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_lex_bot_alias.order_flowers_prod OrderFlowers:OrderFlowersProd
```
