# Action: aws_codebuild_start_build

~> **Note:** `aws_codebuild_start_build` is in beta. Its interface and behavior may change as the feature evolves, and breaking changes are possible. It is offered as a technical preview without compatibility guarantees until Terraform 1.14 is generally available.

Starts a CodeBuild project build. This action will initiate a build and wait for it to complete, providing progress updates during execution.

For information about AWS CodeBuild, see the [AWS CodeBuild User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/). For specific information about starting builds, see the [StartBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/APIReference/API_StartBuild.html) page in the AWS CodeBuild API Reference.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_codebuild_project" "example" {
  name         = "example-project"
  service_role = aws_iam_role.example.arn

  artifacts {
    type = "NO_ARTIFACTS"
  }

  environment {
    compute_type = "BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL"
    image        = "aws/codebuild/amazonlinux2-x86_64-standard:3.0"
    type         = "LINUX_CONTAINER"
  }

  source {
    type      = "NO_SOURCE"
    buildspec = "version: 0.2\nphases:\n  build:\n    commands:\n      - echo 'Hello World'"
  }
}

action "aws_codebuild_start_build" "example" {
  config {
    project_name = aws_codebuild_project.example.name
  }
}

resource "terraform_data" "build_trigger" {
  input = "trigger-build"

  lifecycle {
    action_trigger {
      events  = [after_create]
      actions = [action.aws_codebuild_start_build.example]
    }
  }
}
```

  config {
    project_name   = aws_codebuild_project.deploy.name

    timeout        = 1800

    environment_variables_override {
      name  = "ENVIRONMENT"
      value = "production"
      type  = "PLAINTEXT"
