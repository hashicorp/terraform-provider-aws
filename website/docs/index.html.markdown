# AWS Provider

The Amazon Web Services (AWS) provider is used to interact with the
many resources supported by AWS. The provider needs to be configured
with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Configure the AWS Provider
provider "aws" {
  version = "~> 2.0"
  region  = "us-east-1"
}

# Create a VPC
resource "aws_vpc" "example" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}
```

## Authentication

The AWS provider offers a flexible means of providing credentials for
authentication. The following methods are supported, in this order, and
explained below:

- Static credentials
- Environment variables
- Shared credentials file
- EC2 Role

### Static credentials ###

!> **Warning:** Hard-coding credentials into any Terraform configuration is not
recommended, and risks secret leakage should this file ever be committed to a
public version control system.

Static credentials can be provided by adding an `access_key` and `secret_key`
in-line in the AWS provider block:

Usage:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region     = "us-west-2"
  access_key = "my-access-key"
  secret_key = "my-secret-key"
}
```

### Environment variables

You can provide your credentials via the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, environment variables, representing your AWS
Access Key and AWS Secret Key, respectively.  Note that setting your
AWS credentials using either these (or legacy) environment variables
will override the use of `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` and `AWS_PROFILE`.
The `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` environment variables
are also used, if applicable:

```hcl
provider "aws" {}
```

Usage:

```sh
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="anaccesskey"
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="asecretkey"
$ export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-west-2"
$ terraform plan
```

### Shared Credentials file

You can use an AWS credentials file to specify your credentials. The
default location is `$HOME/.aws/credentials` on Linux and OS X, or
`"%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials"` for Windows users. If we fail to
detect credentials inline, or in the environment, Terraform will check
this location. You can optionally specify a different location in the
configuration by providing the `shared_credentials_file` attribute, or
in the environment with the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` variable. This
method also supports a `profile` configuration and matching
`AWS_PROFILE` environment variable:

Usage:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region                  = "us-west-2"
  shared_credentials_file = "/Users/tf_user/.aws/creds"
  profile                 = "customprofile"
}
```

If specifying the profile through the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable, you
may also need to set `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG` to a truthy value (e.g. `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=1`) for advanced AWS client configurations, such as profiles that use the `source_profile` or `role_arn` configurations.

### ECS and CodeBuild Task Roles

If you're running Terraform on ECS or CodeBuild and you have configured an [IAM Task Role](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html),
Terraform will use the container's Task Role. Terraform looks for the presence of the `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI`
environment variable that AWS injects when a Task Role is configured. If you have not defined a Task Role for your container
or CodeBuild job, Terraform will continue to use the [EC2 Role](#ec2-role).

### EC2 Role

If you're running Terraform from an EC2 instance with IAM Instance Profile
using IAM Role, Terraform will just ask
[the metadata API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html#instance-metadata-security-credentials)
endpoint for credentials.

This is a preferred approach over any other when running in EC2 as you can avoid
hard coding credentials. Instead these are leased on-the-fly by Terraform
which reduces the chance of leakage.

You can provide the custom metadata API endpoint via the `AWS_METADATA_URL` variable
which expects the endpoint URL, including the version, and defaults to `http://169.254.169.254:80/latest`.

The default deadline for the EC2 metadata API endpoint is 100 milliseconds,
which can be overidden by setting the `AWS_METADATA_TIMEOUT` environment
variable. The variable expects a positive golang Time.Duration string, which is
a sequence of decimal numbers and a unit suffix; valid suffixes are `ns`
(nanoseconds), `us` (microseconds), `ms` (milliseconds), `s` (seconds), `m`
(minutes), and `h` (hours). Examples of valid inputs: `100ms`, `250ms`, `1s`,
`2.5s`, `2.5m`, `1m30s`.

### Assume role

If provided with a role ARN, Terraform will attempt to assume this role
using the supplied credentials.

Usage:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  assume_role {
    role_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/ROLE_NAME"
    session_name = "SESSION_NAME"
    external_id  = "EXTERNAL_ID"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

In addition to [generic `provider` arguments](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html)
(e.g. `alias` and `version`), the following arguments are supported in the AWS
 `provider` block:

* `access_key` - (Optional) This is the AWS access key. It must be provided, but
  it can also be sourced from the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` environment variable, or via
  a shared credentials file if `profile` is specified.

* `secret_key` - (Optional) This is the AWS secret key. It must be provided, but
  it can also be sourced from the `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable, or
  via a shared credentials file if `profile` is specified.

* `region` - (Required) This is the AWS region. It must be provided, but
  it can also be sourced from the `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variables, or
  via a shared credentials file if `profile` is specified.

* `profile` - (Optional) This is the AWS profile name as set in the shared credentials
  file.

* `assume_role` - (Optional) An `assume_role` block (documented below). Only one
  `assume_role` block may be in the configuration.

* `endpoints` - (Optional) Configuration block for customizing service endpoints. See the
[Custom Service Endpoints Guide](/docs/providers/aws/guides/custom-service-endpoints.html)
for more information about connecting to alternate AWS endpoints or AWS compatible solutions.

* `shared_credentials_file` = (Optional) This is the path to the shared credentials file.
  If this is not set and a profile is specified, `~/.aws/credentials` will be used.

* `token` - (Optional) Session token for validating temporary credentials. Typically provided after successful identity federation or Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) login. With MFA login, this is the session token provided afterwards, not the 6 digit MFA code used to get temporary credentials.  It can also be sourced from the `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` environment variable.

* `max_retries` - (Optional) This is the maximum number of times an API
  call is retried, in the case where requests are being throttled or
  experiencing transient failures. The delay between the subsequent API
  calls increases exponentially.

* `allowed_account_ids` - (Optional) List of allowed, white listed, AWS
  account IDs to prevent you from mistakenly using an incorrect one (and
  potentially end up destroying a live environment). Conflicts with
  `forbidden_account_ids`.

* `forbidden_account_ids` - (Optional) List of forbidden, blacklisted,
  AWS account IDs to prevent you mistakenly using a wrong one (and
  potentially end up destroying a live environment). Conflicts with
  `allowed_account_ids`.

* `insecure` - (Optional) Explicitly allow the provider to
  perform "insecure" SSL requests. If omitted, default value is `false`.

* `skip_credentials_validation` - (Optional) Skip the credentials
  validation via the STS API. Useful for AWS API implementations that do
  not have STS available or implemented.

* `skip_get_ec2_platforms` - (Optional) Skip getting the supported EC2
  platforms. Used by users that don't have ec2:DescribeAccountAttributes
  permissions.

* `skip_region_validation` - (Optional) Skip validation of provided region name.
  Useful for AWS-like implementations that use their own region names
  or to bypass the validation for regions that aren't publicly available yet.

* `skip_requesting_account_id` - (Optional) Skip requesting the account
  ID.  Useful for AWS API implementations that do not have the IAM, STS
  API, or metadata API.  When set to `true` and not determined previously,
  returns an empty account ID when manually constructing ARN attributes with

  - [`aws_wafregional_ipset` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/wafregional_ipset.html)

* `skip_metadata_api_check` - (Optional) Skip the AWS Metadata API
  check.  Useful for AWS API implementations that do not have a metadata
  API endpoint.  Setting to `true` prevents Terraform from authenticating
  via the Metadata API. You may need to use other authentication methods
  like static credentials, configuration variables, or environment
  variables.

* `s3_force_path_style` - (Optional) Set this to `true` to force the
  request to use path-style addressing, i.e.,
  `http://s3.amazonaws.com/BUCKET/KEY`. By default, the S3 client will use
  virtual hosted bucket addressing, `http://BUCKET.s3.amazonaws.com/KEY`,
  when possible. Specific to the Amazon S3 service.

The nested `assume_role` block supports the following:

* `role_arn` - (Required) The ARN of the role to assume.

* `session_name` - (Optional) The session name to use when making the
  AssumeRole call.

* `external_id` - (Optional) The external ID to use when making the
  AssumeRole call.

* `policy` - (Optional) A more restrictive policy to apply to the temporary credentials.
This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for the resulting temporary
security credentials. You cannot use the passed policy to grant permissions that are
in excess of those allowed by the access policy of the role that is being assumed.

## Getting the Account ID

If you use either `allowed_account_ids` or `forbidden_account_ids`,
Terraform uses several approaches to get the actual account ID
in order to compare it with allowed or forbidden IDs.

Approaches differ per authentication providers:

 * EC2 instance w/ IAM Instance Profile - [Metadata API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html)
    is always used. Introduced in Terraform `0.6.16`.
 * All other providers (environment variable, shared credentials file, ...)
    will try two approaches in the following order
   * `iam:GetUser` - Typically useful for IAM Users. It also means
      that each user needs to be privileged to call `iam:GetUser` for themselves.
   * `sts:GetCallerIdentity` - _Should_ work for both IAM Users and federated IAM Roles,
      introduced in Terraform `0.6.16`.
   * `iam:ListRoles` - This is specifically useful for IdP-federated profiles
      which cannot use `iam:GetUser`. It also means that each federated user
      need to be _assuming_ an IAM role which allows `iam:ListRoles`.
      Used in Terraform `0.6.16+`.
      There used to be no better way to get account ID out of the API
      when using federated account until `sts:GetCallerIdentity` was introduced.
