# Resource: aws_chimesdkvoice_sip_rule

A SIP rule associates your SIP media application with a phone number or a Request URI hostname. You can associate a SIP rule with more than one SIP media application. Each application then runs only that rule.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ChimesdkvoiceSipRule } from "./.gen/providers/aws/chimesdkvoice-sip-rule";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new ChimesdkvoiceSipRule(this, "example", {
      name: "example-sip-rule",
      targetApplications: [
        {
          awsRegion: "us-east-1",
          priority: 1,
          sipMediaApplicationId: exampleSma.id,
        },
      ],
      triggerType: "RequestUriHostname",
      triggerValue: exampleVoiceConnector.outboundHostName,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the SIP rule.
* `targetApplications` - (Required) List of SIP media applications with priority and AWS Region. Only one SIP application per AWS Region can be used. See [`targetApplications`](#target_applications).
* `triggerType` - (Required) The type of trigger assigned to the SIP rule in `triggerValue`. Valid values are `RequestUriHostname` or `ToPhoneNumber`.
* `triggerValue` - (Required) If `triggerType` is `RequestUriHostname`, the value can be the outbound host name of an Amazon Chime Voice Connector. If `triggerType` is `ToPhoneNumber`, the value can be a customer-owned phone number in the E164 format. The Sip Media Application specified in the Sip Rule is triggered if the request URI in an incoming SIP request matches the `RequestUriHostname`, or if the "To" header in the incoming SIP request matches the `ToPhoneNumber` value.

The following arguments are optional:

* `disabled` - (Optional) Enables or disables a rule. You must disable rules before you can delete them.

### `targetApplications`

List of SIP media applications with priority and AWS Region. Only one SIP application per AWS Region can be used.

* `awsRegion` - (Required) The AWS Region of the target application.
* `priority` - (Required) Priority of the SIP media application in the target list.
* `sipMediaApplicationId` - (Required) The SIP media application ID.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The SIP rule ID.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import a ChimeSDKVoice SIP Rule using the `id`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ChimesdkvoiceSipRule } from "./.gen/providers/aws/chimesdkvoice-sip-rule";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    ChimesdkvoiceSipRule.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "abcdef123456"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import a ChimeSDKVoice SIP Rule using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_chimesdkvoice_sip_rule.example abcdef123456
```
