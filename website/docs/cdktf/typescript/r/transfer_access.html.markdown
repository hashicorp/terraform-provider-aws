# Resource: aws_transfer_access

Provides a AWS Transfer Access resource.

## Example Usage

### Basic S3

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { TransferAccess } from "./.gen/providers/aws/transfer-access";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new TransferAccess(this, "example", {
      externalId: "S-1-1-12-1234567890-123456789-1234567890-1234",
      homeDirectory: "/${" + awsS3BucketExample.id + "}/",
      role: Token.asString(awsIamRoleExample.arn),
      serverId: Token.asString(awsTransferServerExample.id),
    });
  }
}

```

### Basic EFS

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { TransferAccess } from "./.gen/providers/aws/transfer-access";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new TransferAccess(this, "test", {
      externalId: "S-1-1-12-1234567890-123456789-1234567890-1234",
      homeDirectory: "/${" + awsEfsFileSystemTest.id + "}/",
      posixProfile: {
        gid: 1000,
        uid: 1000,
      },
      role: Token.asString(awsIamRoleTest.arn),
      serverId: Token.asString(awsTransferServerTest.id),
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `externalId` - (Required) The SID of a group in the directory connected to the Transfer Server (e.g., `S-1-1-12-1234567890-123456789-1234567890-1234`)
* `serverId` - (Required) The Server ID of the Transfer Server (e.g., `s-12345678`)
* `homeDirectory` - (Optional) The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the server using their SFTP client.  It should begin with a `/`.  The first item in the path is the name of the home bucket (accessible as `${Transfer:HomeBucket}` in the policy) and the rest is the home directory (accessible as `${Transfer:HomeDirectory}` in the policy). For example, `/example-bucket-1234/username` would set the home bucket to `example-bucket-1234` and the home directory to `username`.
* `homeDirectoryMappings` - (Optional) Logical directory mappings that specify what S3 paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. See [Home Directory Mappings](#home-directory-mappings) below.
* `homeDirectoryType` - (Optional) The type of landing directory (folder) you mapped for your users' home directory. Valid values are `PATH` and `LOGICAL`.
* `policy` - (Optional) An IAM JSON policy document that scopes down user access to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. IAM variables you can use inside this policy include `${Transfer:UserName}`, `${Transfer:HomeDirectory}`, and `${Transfer:HomeBucket}`. Since the IAM variable syntax matches Terraform's interpolation syntax, they must be escaped inside Terraform configuration strings (`$${Transfer:UserName}`).  These are evaluated on-the-fly when navigating the bucket.
* `posixProfile` - (Optional) Specifies the full POSIX identity, including user ID (Uid), group ID (Gid), and any secondary groups IDs (SecondaryGids), that controls your users' access to your Amazon EFS file systems. See [Posix Profile](#posix-profile) below.
* `role` - (Required) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that allows the service to controls your user’s access to your Amazon S3 bucket.

### Home Directory Mappings

* `entry` - (Required) Represents an entry and a target.
* `target` - (Required) Represents the map target.

### Posix Profile

* `gid` - (Required) The POSIX group ID used for all EFS operations by this user.
* `uid` - (Required) The POSIX user ID used for all EFS operations by this user.
* `secondaryGids` - (Optional) The secondary POSIX group IDs used for all EFS operations by this user.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id`  - The ID of the resource

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Transfer Accesses using the `serverId` and `externalId`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Transfer Accesses using the `serverId` and `externalId`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_transfer_access.example s-12345678/S-1-1-12-1234567890-123456789-1234567890-1234
```
