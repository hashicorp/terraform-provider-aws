# Resource: aws_route53domains_domain

Provides a resource to manage a domain. This resource registers, renews and deregisters a domain name. If a domain name's lifecycle is managed outside of Terraform use the [`aws_route53domains_registered_domain` resource](route53domains_registered_domain.html) instead.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Route53DomainsDomain } from "./.gen/providers/aws/";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new Route53DomainsDomain(this, "example", {

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import domains using the `domainName`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Route53DomainsDomain } from "./.gen/providers/aws/";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    Route53DomainsDomain.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "example.com"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import domains using the `domainName`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_route53domains_domain.example example.com
```
