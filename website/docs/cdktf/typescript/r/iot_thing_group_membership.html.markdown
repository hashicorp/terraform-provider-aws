# Resource: aws_iot_thing_group_membership

Adds an IoT Thing to an IoT Thing Group.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { IotThingGroupMembership } from "./.gen/providers/aws/iot-thing-group-membership";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new IotThingGroupMembership(this, "example", {
      overrideDynamicGroup: true,
      thingGroupName: "example-group",
      thingName: "example-thing",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

* `thingName` - (Required) The name of the thing to add to a group.
* `thingGroupName` - (Required) The name of the group to which you are adding a thing.
* `overrideDynamicGroup` - (Optional) Override dynamic thing groups with static thing groups when 10-group limit is reached. If a thing belongs to 10 thing groups, and one or more of those groups are dynamic thing groups, adding a thing to a static group removes the thing from the last dynamic group.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The membership ID.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import IoT Thing Group Membership using the thing group name and thing name. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { IotThingGroupMembership } from "./.gen/providers/aws/iot-thing-group-membership";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    IotThingGroupMembership.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "thing_group_name/thing_name"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import IoT Thing Group Membership using the thing group name and thing name. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_iot_thing_group_membership.example thing_group_name/thing_name
```
