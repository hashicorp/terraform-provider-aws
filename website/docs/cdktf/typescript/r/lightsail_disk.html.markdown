# Resource: aws_lightsail_disk

Manages a Lightsail disk. Use this resource to create additional block storage that can be attached to Lightsail instances for extra storage capacity.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Fn, Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsAvailabilityZones } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-availability-zones";
import { LightsailDisk } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-disk";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const available = new DataAwsAvailabilityZones(this, "available", {
      filter: [
        {
          name: "opt-in-status",
          values: ["opt-in-not-required"],
        },
      ],
      state: "available",
    });
    new LightsailDisk(this, "example", {
      availabilityZone: Token.asString(Fn.lookupNested(available.names, ["0"])),
      name: "example-disk",
      sizeInGb: 8,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `availabilityZone` - (Required) Availability Zone in which to create the disk.
* `name` - (Required) Name of the disk. Must begin with an alphabetic character and contain only alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and dots.
* `sizeInGb` - (Required) Size of the disk in GB.

The following arguments are optional:

* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags to assign to the resource. To create a key-only tag, use an empty string as the value. If configured with a provider `defaultTags` configuration block present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - ARN of the disk.
* `createdAt` - Date and time when the disk was created.
* `id` - Name of the disk (matches `name`).
* `supportCode` - Support code for the disk. Include this code in your email to support when you have questions about a disk in Lightsail.
* `tagsAll` - Map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider `defaultTags` configuration block.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_lightsail_disk` using the name attribute. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LightsailDisk } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-disk";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    LightsailDisk.generateConfigForImport(this, "example", "example-disk");
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_lightsail_disk` using the name attribute. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_lightsail_disk.example example-disk
```
