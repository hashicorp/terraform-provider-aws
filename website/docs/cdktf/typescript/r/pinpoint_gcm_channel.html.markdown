## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Fn, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { PinpointApp } from "./.gen/providers/aws/pinpoint-app";
import { PinpointGcmChannel } from "./.gen/providers/aws/pinpoint-gcm-channel";
interface MyConfig {
  apiKey: any;
}
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string, config: MyConfig) {
    super(scope, name);
    const app = new PinpointApp(this, "app", {});
    new PinpointGcmChannel(this, "gcm", {
      applicationId: app.applicationId,
      default_authentication_method: "TOKEN",
      service_json: Fn.file("path_to_service_json"),
      apiKey: config.apiKey,
    });
  }
}

```

* `enabled` - (Optional) Whether the channel is enabled or disabled. Defaults to `true`.

## Attribute Reference

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Pinpoint GCM Channel using the `application-id`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { PinpointGcmChannel } from "./.gen/providers/aws/pinpoint-gcm-channel";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    PinpointGcmChannel.generateConfigForImport(this, "gcm", "application-id");
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Pinpoint GCM Channel using the `application-id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_pinpoint_gcm_channel.gcm application-id
```
