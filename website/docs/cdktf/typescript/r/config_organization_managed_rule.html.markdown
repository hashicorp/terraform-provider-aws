# Resource: aws_config_organization_managed_rule

Manages a Config Organization Managed Rule. More information about these rules can be found in the [Enabling AWS Config Rules Across all Accounts in Your Organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/config-rule-multi-account-deployment.html) and [AWS Config Managed Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config_use-managed-rules.html) documentation. For working with Organization Custom Rules (those invoking a custom Lambda Function), see the [`aws_config_organization_custom_rule` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/config_organization_custom_rule.html).

~> **NOTE:** This resource must be created in the Organization master account and rules will include the master account unless its ID is added to the `excludedAccounts` argument.

~> **NOTE:** Every Organization account except those configured in the `excludedAccounts` argument must have a Configuration Recorder with proper IAM permissions before the rule will successfully create or update. See also the [`aws_config_configuration_recorder` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/config_configuration_recorder.html).

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ConfigOrganizationManagedRule } from "./.gen/providers/aws/config-organization-managed-rule";
import { OrganizationsOrganization } from "./.gen/providers/aws/organizations-organization";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new OrganizationsOrganization(this, "example", {
      awsServiceAccessPrincipals: ["config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com"],
      featureSet: "ALL",
    });
    const awsConfigOrganizationManagedRuleExample =
      new ConfigOrganizationManagedRule(this, "example_1", {
        dependsOn: [example],
        name: "example",
        ruleIdentifier: "IAM_PASSWORD_POLICY",
      });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsConfigOrganizationManagedRuleExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the rule
* `ruleIdentifier` - (Required) Identifier of an available AWS Config Managed Rule to call. For available values, see the [List of AWS Config Managed Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html) documentation
* `description` - (Optional) Description of the rule
* `excludedAccounts` - (Optional) List of AWS account identifiers to exclude from the rule
* `inputParameters` - (Optional) A string in JSON format that is passed to the AWS Config Rule Lambda Function
* `maximumExecutionFrequency` - (Optional) The maximum frequency with which AWS Config runs evaluations for a rule, if the rule is triggered at a periodic frequency. Defaults to `TwentyFour_Hours` for periodic frequency triggered rules. Valid values: `One_Hour`, `Three_Hours`, `Six_Hours`, `Twelve_Hours`, or `TwentyFour_Hours`.
* `resourceIdScope` - (Optional) Identifier of the AWS resource to evaluate
* `resourceTypesScope` - (Optional) List of types of AWS resources to evaluate
* `tagKeyScope` - (Optional, Required if `tagValueScope` is configured) Tag key of AWS resources to evaluate
* `tagValueScope` - (Optional) Tag value of AWS resources to evaluate

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `create` - (Default `5m`)
* `delete` - (Default `5m`)
* `update` - (Default `5m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Config Organization Managed Rules using the name. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ConfigOrganizationManagedRule } from "./.gen/providers/aws/config-organization-managed-rule";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    ConfigOrganizationManagedRule.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "example"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Config Organization Managed Rules using the name. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_config_organization_managed_rule.example example
```
