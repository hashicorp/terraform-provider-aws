# Resource: aws_iam_user_policy_attachment

Attaches a Managed IAM Policy to an IAM user

~> **NOTE:** The usage of this resource conflicts with the `aws_iam_policy_attachment` resource and will permanently show a difference if both are defined.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { IamPolicy } from "./.gen/providers/aws/iam-policy";
import { IamUser } from "./.gen/providers/aws/iam-user";
import { IamUserPolicyAttachment } from "./.gen/providers/aws/iam-user-policy-attachment";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const policy = new IamPolicy(this, "policy", {
      description: "A test policy",
      name: "test-policy",
      policy: "{ ... policy JSON ... }",
    });
    const user = new IamUser(this, "user", {
      name: "test-user",
    });
    new IamUserPolicyAttachment(this, "test-attach", {
      policyArn: policy.arn,
      user: user.name,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `user`        (Required) - The user the policy should be applied to
* `policyArn`  (Required) - The ARN of the policy you want to apply

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports no additional attributes.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import IAM user policy attachments using the user name and policy arn separated by `/`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { IamUserPolicyAttachment } from "./.gen/providers/aws/iam-user-policy-attachment";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    IamUserPolicyAttachment.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "testAttach",
      "test-user/arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:policy/test-policy"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import IAM user policy attachments using the user name and policy arn separated by `/`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_iam_user_policy_attachment.test-attach test-user/arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:policy/test-policy
```
