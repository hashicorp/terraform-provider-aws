# Resource: aws_route53_delegation_set

Provides a [Route53 Delegation Set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API-actions-by-function.html#actions-by-function-reusable-delegation-sets) resource.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Route53DelegationSet } from "./.gen/providers/aws/route53-delegation-set";
import { Route53Zone } from "./.gen/providers/aws/route53-zone";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const main = new Route53DelegationSet(this, "main", {
      referenceName: "DynDNS",
    });
    new Route53Zone(this, "primary", {
      delegationSetId: main.id,
      name: "hashicorp.com",
    });
    new Route53Zone(this, "secondary", {
      delegationSetId: main.id,
      name: "terraform.io",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `referenceName` - (Optional) This is a reference name used in Caller Reference
  (helpful for identifying single delegation set amongst others)

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Delegation Set.
* `id` - The delegation set ID
* `nameServers` - A list of authoritative name servers for the hosted zone
  (effectively a list of NS records).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Route53 Delegation Sets using the delegation set `id`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Route53DelegationSet } from "./.gen/providers/aws/route53-delegation-set";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    Route53DelegationSet.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "set1",
      "N1PA6795SAMPLE"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Route53 Delegation Sets using the delegation set `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_route53_delegation_set.set1 N1PA6795SAMPLE
```
