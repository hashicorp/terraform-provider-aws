## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Route53 Traffic Policy using the `id` and `version`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Route53 Traffic Policy using the `id` and `version`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_route53_traffic_policy.example 01a52019-d16f-422a-ae72-c306d2b6df7e/1
```
