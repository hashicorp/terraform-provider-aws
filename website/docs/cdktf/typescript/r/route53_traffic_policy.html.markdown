 */
import { Route53TrafficPolicy } from "./.gen/providers/aws/route53-traffic-policy";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new Route53TrafficPolicy(this, "example", {
      comment: "example comment",
      document:
        '{\n  "AWSPolicyFormatVersion": "2015-10-01",\n  "RecordType": "A",\n  "Endpoints": {\n    "endpoint-start-NkPh": {\n      "Type": "value",\n      "Value": "10.0.0.2"\n    }\n  },\n  "StartEndpoint": "endpoint-start-NkPh"\n}\n\n',

The following arguments are required:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the traffic policy.
* `document` - (Required) Policy document. This is a JSON formatted string. For more information about building Route53 traffic policy documents, see the [AWS Route53 Traffic Policy document format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/api-policies-traffic-policy-document-format.html)

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - ID of the traffic policy
* `type` - DNS type of the resource record sets that Amazon Route 53 creates when you use a traffic policy to create a traffic policy instance.
* `version` - Version number of the traffic policy. This value is automatically incremented by AWS after each update of this resource.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Route53 Traffic Policy using the `id` and `version`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Route53TrafficPolicy } from "./.gen/providers/aws/route53-traffic-policy";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    Route53TrafficPolicy.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "01a52019-d16f-422a-ae72-c306d2b6df7e/1"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Route53 Traffic Policy using the `id` and `version`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_route53_traffic_policy.example 01a52019-d16f-422a-ae72-c306d2b6df7e/1
```
