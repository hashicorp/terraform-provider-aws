# Resource: aws_lightsail_certificate

Manages a Lightsail certificate. Use this resource to create and manage SSL/TLS certificates for securing custom domains with your Lightsail resources.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LightsailCertificate } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-certificate";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new LightsailCertificate(this, "example", {
      domainName: "example.com",
      name: "example-certificate",
      subjectAlternativeNames: ["www.example.com"],
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the certificate.

The following arguments are optional:

* `domainName` - (Optional) Domain name for which the certificate should be issued.
* `subjectAlternativeNames` - (Optional) Set of domains that should be SANs in the issued certificate. `domainName` attribute is automatically added as a Subject Alternative Name.
* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags to assign to the resource. To create a key-only tag, use an empty string as the value. If configured with a provider `defaultTags` configuration block present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - ARN of the certificate.
* `createdAt` - Date and time when the certificate was created.
* `domainValidationOptions` - Set of domain validation objects which can be used to complete certificate validation. Can have more than one element, e.g., if SANs are defined. Each element contains the following attributes:
    * `domainName` - Domain name for which the certificate should be issued.
    * `resource_record_name` - Name of the DNS record to create to validate the certificate.
    * `resource_record_type` - Type of DNS record to create to validate the certificate.
    * `resource_record_value` - Value of the DNS record to create to validate the certificate.
* `id` - Name of the certificate (matches `name`).
* `tagsAll` - Map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider `defaultTags` configuration block.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_lightsail_certificate` using the certificate name. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LightsailCertificate } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-certificate";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    LightsailCertificate.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "example-certificate"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_lightsail_certificate` using the certificate name. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_lightsail_certificate.example example-certificate
```
