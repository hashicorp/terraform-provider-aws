# Resource: aws_pinpoint_apns_voip_sandbox_channel

Provides a Pinpoint APNs VoIP Sandbox Channel resource.

~> **Note:** All arguments, including certificates and tokens, will be stored in the raw state as plain-text.
[Read more about sensitive data in state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Fn, Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { PinpointApnsVoipSandboxChannel } from "./.gen/providers/aws/pinpoint-apns-voip-sandbox-channel";
import { PinpointApp } from "./.gen/providers/aws/pinpoint-app";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const app = new PinpointApp(this, "app", {});
    new PinpointApnsVoipSandboxChannel(this, "apns_voip_sandbox", {
      applicationId: app.applicationId,
      certificate: Token.asString(Fn.file("./certificate.pem")),
      privateKey: Token.asString(Fn.file("./private_key.key")),
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `applicationId` - (Required) The application ID.
* `enabled` - (Optional) Whether the channel is enabled or disabled. Defaults to `true`.
* `defaultAuthenticationMethod` - (Optional) The default authentication method used for APNs.
  __NOTE__: Amazon Pinpoint uses this default for every APNs push notification that you send using the console.
  You can override the default when you send a message programmatically using the Amazon Pinpoint API, the AWS CLI, or an AWS SDK.
  If your default authentication type fails, Amazon Pinpoint doesn't attempt to use the other authentication type.

One of the following sets of credentials is also required.

If you choose to use __Certificate credentials__ you will have to provide:

* `certificate` - (Required) The pem encoded TLS Certificate from Apple.
* `privateKey` - (Required) The Certificate Private Key file (ie. `.key` file).

If you choose to use __Key credentials__ you will have to provide:

* `bundleId` - (Required) The ID assigned to your iOS app. To find this value, choose Certificates, IDs & Profiles, choose App IDs in the Identifiers section, and choose your app.
* `teamId` - (Required) The ID assigned to your Apple developer account team. This value is provided on the Membership page.
* `tokenKey` - (Required) The `.p8` file that you download from your Apple developer account when you create an authentication key.
* `tokenKeyId` - (Required) The ID assigned to your signing key. To find this value, choose Certificates, IDs & Profiles, and choose your key in the Keys section.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports no additional attributes.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Pinpoint APNs VoIP Sandbox Channel using the `applicationId`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Pinpoint APNs VoIP Sandbox Channel using the `applicationId`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_pinpoint_apns_voip_sandbox_channel.apns_voip_sandbox application-id
```
