## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `azMode` - (Required) The number of availability zones you want to assign per cluster. This can be one of the following:
    * SINGLE - Assigns one availability zone per cluster.
    * MULTI - Assigns all the availability zones per cluster.
* `capacityConfiguration` - (Required) Structure for the metadata of a cluster. Includes information like the CPUs needed, memory of instances, and number of instances. See [capacity_configuration](#capacity_configuration).
* `environmentId` - (Required) Unique identifier for the KX environment.
* `name` - (Required) Unique name for the cluster that you want to create.
* `releaseLabel` - (Required) Version of FinSpace Managed kdb to run.
* `type` - (Required) Type of KDB database. The following types are available:
    * HDB - Historical Database. The data is only accessible with read-only permissions from one of the FinSpace managed KX databases mounted to the cluster.
    * RDB - Realtime Database. This type of database captures all the data from a ticker plant and stores it in memory until the end of day, after which it writes all of its data to a disk and reloads the HDB. This cluster type requires local storage for temporary storage of data during the savedown process. If you specify this field in your request, you must provide the `savedownStorageConfiguration` parameter.
    * GATEWAY - A gateway cluster allows you to access data across processes in kdb systems. It allows you to create your own routing logic using the initialization scripts and custom code. This type of cluster does not require a  writable local storage.
    * GP - A general purpose cluster allows you to quickly iterate on code during development by granting greater access to system commands and enabling a fast reload of custom code. This cluster type can optionally mount databases including cache and savedown storage. For this cluster type, the node count is fixed at 1. It does not support autoscaling and supports only `SINGLE` AZ mode.
    * Tickerplant – A tickerplant cluster allows you to subscribe to feed handlers based on IAM permissions. It can publish to RDBs, other Tickerplants, and real-time subscribers (RTS). Tickerplants can persist messages to log, which is readable by any RDB environment. It supports only single-node that is only one kdb process.
* `vpcConfiguration` - (Required) Configuration details about the network where the Privatelink endpoint of the cluster resides. See [vpc_configuration](#vpc_configuration).

The following arguments are optional:

* `autoScalingConfiguration` - (Optional) Configuration based on which FinSpace will scale in or scale out nodes in your cluster. See [auto_scaling_configuration](#auto_scaling_configuration).
* `availabilityZoneId` - (Optional) The availability zone identifiers for the requested regions. Required when `azMode` is set to SINGLE.
* `cacheStorageConfigurations` - (Optional) Configurations for a read only cache storage associated with a cluster. This cache will be stored as an FSx Lustre that reads from the S3 store. See [cache_storage_configuration](#cache_storage_configuration).
* `code` - (Optional) Details of the custom code that you want to use inside a cluster when analyzing data. Consists of the S3 source bucket, location, object version, and the relative path from where the custom code is loaded into the cluster. See [code](#code).
* `commandLineArguments` - (Optional) List of key-value pairs to make available inside the cluster.
* `database` - (Optional) KX database that will be available for querying. Defined below.
* `description` - (Optional) Description of the cluster.
* `executionRole` - (Optional) An IAM role that defines a set of permissions associated with a cluster. These permissions are assumed when a cluster attempts to access another cluster.
* `initializationScript` - (Optional) Path to Q program that will be run at launch of a cluster. This is a relative path within .zip file that contains the custom code, which will be loaded on the cluster. It must include the file name itself. For example, somedir/init.q.
* `savedownStorageConfiguration` - (Optional) Size and type of the temporary storage that is used to hold data during the savedown process. This parameter is required when you choose `type` as RDB. All the data written to this storage space is lost when the cluster node is restarted. See [savedown_storage_configuration](#savedown_storage_configuration).
* `scalingGroupConfiguration` - (Optional) The structure that stores the configuration details of a scaling group.
* `tickerplantLogConfiguration` - A configuration to store Tickerplant logs. It consists of a list of volumes that will be mounted to your cluster. For the cluster type Tickerplant , the location of the TP volume on the cluster will be available by using the global variable .aws.tp_log_path.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value mapping of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

### auto_scaling_configuration

The auto_scaling_configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `autoScalingMetric` - (Required) Metric your cluster will track in order to scale in and out. For example, CPU_UTILIZATION_PERCENTAGE is the average CPU usage across all nodes in a cluster.
* `minNodeCount` - (Required) Lowest number of nodes to scale. Must be at least 1 and less than the `maxNodeCount`. If nodes in cluster belong to multiple availability zones, then `minNodeCount` must be at least 3.
* `maxNodeCount` - (Required) Highest number of nodes to scale. Cannot be greater than 5
* `metricTarget` - (Required) Desired value of chosen `autoScalingMetric`. When metric drops below this value, cluster will scale in. When metric goes above this value, cluster will scale out. Can be set between 0 and 100 percent.
* `scaleInCooldownSeconds` - (Required) Duration in seconds that FinSpace will wait after a scale in event before initiating another scaling event.
* `scaleOutCooldownSeconds` - (Required) Duration in seconds that FinSpace will wait after a scale out event before initiating another scaling event.

### capacity_configuration

The capacity_configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `nodeType` - (Required) Determines the hardware of the host computer used for your cluster instance. Each node type offers different memory and storage capabilities. Choose a node type based on the requirements of the application or software that you plan to run on your instance.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import an AWS FinSpace Kx Cluster using the `id` (environment ID and cluster name, comma-delimited). For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { FinspaceKxCluster } from "./.gen/providers/aws/finspace-kx-cluster";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    FinspaceKxCluster.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "n3ceo7wqxoxcti5tujqwzs,my-tf-kx-cluster"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import an AWS FinSpace Kx Cluster using the `id` (environment ID and cluster name, comma-delimited). For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_finspace_kx_cluster.example n3ceo7wqxoxcti5tujqwzs,my-tf-kx-cluster
```
