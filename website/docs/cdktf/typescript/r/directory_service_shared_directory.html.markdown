# Resource: aws_directory_service_shared_directory

Manages a directory in your account (directory owner) shared with another account (directory consumer).

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Fn, Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DirectoryServiceDirectory } from "./.gen/providers/aws/directory-service-directory";
import { DirectoryServiceSharedDirectory } from "./.gen/providers/aws/directory-service-shared-directory";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new DirectoryServiceDirectory(this, "example", {
      edition: "Standard",
      name: "tf-example",
      password: "SuperSecretPassw0rd",
      type: "MicrosoftAD",
      vpcSettings: {
        subnetIds: Token.asList(Fn.lookupNested(awsSubnetExample, ["*", "id"])),
        vpcId: Token.asString(awsVpcExample.id),
      },
    });
    const awsDirectoryServiceSharedDirectoryExample =
      new DirectoryServiceSharedDirectory(this, "example_1", {
        directoryId: example.id,
        notes: "You wanna have a catch?",
        target: {
          id: Token.asString(receiver.accountId),
        },
      });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsDirectoryServiceSharedDirectoryExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `directoryId` - (Required) Identifier of the Managed Microsoft AD directory that you want to share with other accounts.
* `target` - (Required) Identifier for the directory consumer account with whom the directory is to be shared. See below.

The following arguments are optional:

* `method` - (Optional) Method used when sharing a directory. Valid values are `ORGANIZATIONS` and `HANDSHAKE`. Default is `HANDSHAKE`.
* `notes` - (Optional, Sensitive) Message sent by the directory owner to the directory consumer to help the directory consumer administrator determine whether to approve or reject the share invitation.

### `target`

* `type` - (Optional) Type of identifier to be used in the `id` field. Valid value is `ACCOUNT`. Default is `ACCOUNT`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - Identifier of the shared directory.
* `sharedDirectoryId` - Identifier of the directory that is stored in the directory consumer account that corresponds to the shared directory in the owner account.

## Timeouts

`aws_directory_service_shared_directory` provides the following [Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) configuration options:

- `delete` - (Default `60 minutes`) Used for shared directory deletion

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Directory Service Shared Directories using the owner directory ID/shared directory ID. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DirectoryServiceSharedDirectory } from "./.gen/providers/aws/directory-service-shared-directory";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    DirectoryServiceSharedDirectory.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "d-1234567890/d-9267633ece"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Directory Service Shared Directories using the owner directory ID/shared directory ID. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_directory_service_shared_directory.example d-1234567890/d-9267633ece
```
