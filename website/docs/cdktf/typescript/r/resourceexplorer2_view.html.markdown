# Resource: aws_resourceexplorer2_view

Provides a resource to manage a Resource Explorer view.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Resourceexplorer2Index } from "./.gen/providers/aws/resourceexplorer2-index";
import { Resourceexplorer2View } from "./.gen/providers/aws/resourceexplorer2-view";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new Resourceexplorer2Index(this, "example", {
      type: "LOCAL",
    });
    const awsResourceexplorer2ViewExample = new Resourceexplorer2View(
      this,
      "example_1",
      {
        dependsOn: [example],
        filters: [
          {
            filterString: "resourcetype:ec2:instance",
          },
        ],
        includedProperty: [
          {
            name: "tags",
          },
        ],
        name: "exampleview",
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsResourceexplorer2ViewExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `defaultView` - (Optional) Specifies whether the view is the [_default view_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-views-about.html#manage-views-about-default) for the AWS Region. Default: `false`.
* `filters` - (Optional) Specifies which resources are included in the results of queries made using this view. See [Filters](#filters) below for more details.
* `includedProperty` - (Optional) Optional fields to be included in search results from this view. See [Included Properties](#included-properties) below for more details.
* `name` - (Required) The name of the view. The name must be no more than 64 characters long, and can include letters, digits, and the dash (-) character. The name must be unique within its AWS Region.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

### Filters

The `filters` block supports the following:

* `filterString` - (Required) The string that contains the search keywords, prefixes, and operators to control the results that can be returned by a search operation. For more details, see [Search query syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/using-search-query-syntax.html).

### Included Properties

The `includedProperty` block supports the following:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the property that is included in this view. Valid values: `tags`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Resource Explorer view.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Resource Explorer views using the `arn`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Resourceexplorer2View } from "./.gen/providers/aws/resourceexplorer2-view";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    Resourceexplorer2View.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-west-2:123456789012:view/exampleview/e0914f6c-6c27-4b47-b5d4-6b28381a2421"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Resource Explorer views using the `arn`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_resourceexplorer2_view.example arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-west-2:123456789012:view/exampleview/e0914f6c-6c27-4b47-b5d4-6b28381a2421
```
