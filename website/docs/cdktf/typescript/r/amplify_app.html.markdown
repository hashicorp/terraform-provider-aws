# Resource: aws_amplify_app

Provides an Amplify App resource, a fullstack serverless app hosted on the [AWS Amplify Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/welcome.html).

~> **Note:** When you create/update an Amplify App from Terraform, you may end up with the error "BadRequestException: You should at least provide one valid token" because of authentication issues. See the section "Repository with Tokens" below.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { AmplifyApp } from "./.gen/providers/aws/amplify-app";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new AmplifyApp(this, "example", {
      buildSpec:
        "version: 0.1\nfrontend:\n  phases:\n    preBuild:\n      commands:\n        - yarn install\n    build:\n      commands:\n        - yarn run build\n  artifacts:\n    baseDirectory: build\n    files:\n      - '**/*'\n  cache:\n    paths:\n      - node_modules/**/*\n\n",
      customRule: [
        {
          source: "/<*>",
          status: "404",
          target: "/index.html",
        },
      ],
      environmentVariables: {
        ENV: "test",
      },
      name: "example",
      repository: "https://github.com/example/app",
    });
  }
}

```

### Repository with Tokens

If you create a new Amplify App with the `repository` argument, you also need to set `oauthToken` or `accessToken` for authentication. For GitHub, get a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) and set `accessToken` as follows:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { AmplifyApp } from "./.gen/providers/aws/amplify-app";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new AmplifyApp(this, "example", {
      accessToken: "...",
      name: "example",
      repository: "https://github.com/example/app",
    });
  }
}

```

You can omit `accessToken` if you import an existing Amplify App created by the Amplify Console (using OAuth for authentication).

### Auto Branch Creation

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { AmplifyApp } from "./.gen/providers/aws/amplify-app";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new AmplifyApp(this, "example", {
      autoBranchCreationConfig: {
        enableAutoBuild: true,
      },
      autoBranchCreationPatterns: ["*", "*/**"],
      enableAutoBranchCreation: true,
      name: "example",
    });
  }
}

```

### Basic Authorization

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Fn, Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { AmplifyApp } from "./.gen/providers/aws/amplify-app";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new AmplifyApp(this, "example", {
      basicAuthCredentials: Token.asString(
        Fn.base64encode("username1:password1")
      ),
      enableBasicAuth: true,
      name: "example",
    });
  }
}

```

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Amplify App using Amplify App ID (appId). For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Amplify App using Amplify App ID (appId). For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_amplify_app.example d2ypk4k47z8u6
```

App ID can be obtained from App ARN (e.g., `arn:aws:amplify:usEast1:12345678:apps/d2Ypk4K47Z8U6`).
