import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LexBotAlias } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lex-bot-alias";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new LexBotAlias(this, "order_flowers_prod", {
      botName: "OrderFlowers",
      botVersion: "1",
      description: "Production Version of the OrderFlowers Bot.",
      name: "OrderFlowersProd",

* `create` - (Default `1m`)
* `update` - (Default `1m`)
* `delete` - (Default `5m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import bot aliases using an ID with the format `bot_name:bot_alias_name`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LexBotAlias } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lex-bot-alias";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    LexBotAlias.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "orderFlowersProd",
      "OrderFlowers:OrderFlowersProd"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import bot aliases using an ID with the format `bot_name:bot_alias_name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_lex_bot_alias.order_flowers_prod OrderFlowers:OrderFlowersProd
```
