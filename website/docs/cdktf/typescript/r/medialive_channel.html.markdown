If you plan to convert the ancillary captions to another format, complete this field. If you plan to choose Embedded as the captions destination in the output (to pass through all the channels in the ancillary captions), leave this field blank because MediaLive ignores the field.

### DVB Sub Source Settings

* `ocrLanguage` - (Optional) If you will configure a WebVTT caption description that references this caption selector, use this field to provide the language to consider when translating the image-based source to text.
* `pid` - (Optional) When using DVB-Sub with Burn-In or SMPTE-TT, use this PID for the source content. Unused for DVB-Sub passthrough. All DVB-Sub content is passed through, regardless of selectors.

### Embedded Source Settings

* `convert608To708` - (Optional) If upconvert, 608 data is both passed through via the “608 compatibility bytes” fields of the 708 wrapper as well as translated into 708. 708 data present in the source content will be discarded.

* `pid` - (Optional) The pid field is used in conjunction with the caption selector languageCode field as follows: - Specify PID and Language: Extracts captions from that PID; the language is "informational". - Specify PID and omit Language: Extracts the specified PID. - Omit PID and specify Language: Extracts the specified language, whichever PID that happens to be. - Omit PID and omit Language: Valid only if source is DVB-Sub that is being passed through; all languages will be passed through.

### Teletext Source Settings

* `outputRectangle` - (Optional) Optionally defines a region where TTML style captions will be displayed. See [Caption Rectangle](#caption-rectangle) for more details.
* `pageNumber` - (Optional) Specifies the teletext page number within the data stream from which to extract captions. Range of 0x100 (256) to 0x8FF (2303). Unused for passthrough. Should be specified as a hexadecimal string with no “0x” prefix.

### Caption Rectangle

* `height` - (Required) See the description in left\_offset. For height, specify the entire height of the rectangle as a percentage of the underlying frame height. For example, "80" means the rectangle height is 80% of the underlying frame height. The top\_offset and rectangle\_height must add up to 100% or less. This field corresponds to tts:extent - Y in the TTML standard.
* `leftOffset` - (Required) Applies only if you plan to convert these source captions to EBU-TT-D or TTML in an output. (Make sure to leave the default if you don’t have either of these formats in the output.) You can define a display rectangle for the captions that is smaller than the underlying video frame. You define the rectangle by specifying the position of the left edge, top edge, bottom edge, and right edge of the rectangle, all within the underlying video frame. The units for the measurements are percentages. If you specify a value for one of these fields, you must specify a value for all of them. For leftOffset, specify the position of the left edge of the rectangle, as a percentage of the underlying frame width, and relative to the left edge of the frame. For example, "10" means the measurement is 10% of the underlying frame width. The rectangle left edge starts at that position from the left edge of the frame. This field corresponds to tts:origin - X in the TTML standard.
* `topOffset` - (Required) See the description in left\_offset. For top\_offset, specify the position of the top edge of the rectangle, as a percentage of the underlying frame height, and relative to the top edge of the frame. For example, "10" means the measurement is 10% of the underlying frame height. The rectangle top edge starts at that position from the top edge of the frame. This field corresponds to tts:origin - Y in the TTML standard.
* `width` - (Required) See the description in left\_offset. For width, specify the entire width of the rectangle as a percentage of the underlying frame width. For example, "80" means the rectangle width is 80% of the underlying frame width. The left\_offset and rectangle\_width must add up to 100% or less. This field corresponds to tts:extent - X in the TTML standard.

### Network Input Settings

* `hlsInputSettings` - (Optional) Specifies HLS input settings when the uri is for a HLS manifest. See [HLS Input Settings](#hls-input-settings) for more details.
* `serverValidation` - (Optional) Check HTTPS server certificates.

### HLS Input Settings

* `bandwidth` - (Optional) The bitrate is specified in bits per second, as in an HLS manifest.
* `bufferSegments` - (Optional) Buffer segments.
* `retries` - (Optional) The number of consecutive times that attempts to read a manifest or segment must fail before the input is considered unavailable.
* `retryInterval` - (Optional) The number of seconds between retries when an attempt to read a manifest or segment fails.
* `scte35_source_type` - (Optional) Identifies the source for the SCTE-35 messages that MediaLive will ingest.

### Automatic Input Failover Settings

* `secondaryInputId` - (Required) The input ID of the secondary input in the automatic input failover pair.
* `errorClearTimeMsec` - (Optional) This clear time defines the requirement a recovered input must meet to be considered healthy. The input must have no failover conditions for this length of time. Enter a time in milliseconds. This value is particularly important if the input\_preference for the failover pair is set to PRIMARY\_INPUT\_PREFERRED, because after this time, MediaLive will switch back to the primary input.
* `failoverCondition` - (Optional) A list of failover conditions. If any of these conditions occur, MediaLive will perform a failover to the other input. See [Failover Condition Block](#failover-condition-block) for more details.
* `inputPreference` - (Optional) Input preference when deciding which input to make active when a previously failed input has recovered.

### Failover Condition Block

* `failoverConditionSettings` - (Optional) Failover condition type-specific settings. See [Failover Condition Settings](#failover-condition-settings) for more details.

### Failover Condition Settings

* `audioSilenceSettings` - (Optional) MediaLive will perform a failover if the specified audio selector is silent for the specified period. See [Audio Silence Failover Settings](#audio-silence-failover-settings) for more details.
* `inputLossSettings` - (Optional) MediaLive will perform a failover if content is not detected in this input for the specified period. See [Input Loss Failover Settings](#input-loss-failover-settings) for more details.
* `videoBlackSettings` - (Optional) MediaLive will perform a failover if content is considered black for the specified period. See [Video Black Failover Settings](#video-black-failover-settings) for more details.

### Audio Silence Failover Settings

* `audioSelectorName` - (Required) The name of the audio selector in the input that MediaLive should monitor to detect silence. Select your most important rendition. If you didn't create an audio selector in this input, leave blank.
* `audioSilenceThresholdMsec` - (Optional) The amount of time (in milliseconds) that the active input must be silent before automatic input failover occurs. Silence is defined as audio loss or audio quieter than -50 dBFS.

### Input Loss Failover Settings

* `inputLossThresholdMsec` - (Optional) The amount of time (in milliseconds) that no input is detected. After that time, an input failover will occur.

### Video Black Failover Settings

* `blackDetectThreshold` - (Optional) A value used in calculating the threshold below which MediaLive considers a pixel to be 'black'. For the input to be considered black, every pixel in a frame must be below this threshold. The threshold is calculated as a percentage (expressed as a decimal) of white. Therefore .1 means 10% white (or 90% black). Note how the formula works for any color depth. For example, if you set this field to 0.1 in 10-bit color depth: (10230.1=102.3), which means a pixel value of 102 or less is 'black'. If you set this field to .1 in an 8-bit color depth: (2550.1=25.5), which means a pixel value of 25 or less is 'black'. The range is 0.0 to 1.0, with any number of decimal places.
