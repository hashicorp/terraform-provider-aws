# Resource: aws_detective_member

Provides a resource to manage an [Amazon Detective Member](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/APIReference/API_CreateMembers.html).

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DetectiveGraph } from "./.gen/providers/aws/detective-graph";
import { DetectiveMember } from "./.gen/providers/aws/detective-member";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new DetectiveGraph(this, "example", {});
    const awsDetectiveMemberExample = new DetectiveMember(this, "example_1", {
      accountId: "AWS ACCOUNT ID",
      disableEmailNotification: true,
      emailAddress: "EMAIL",
      graphArn: example.id,
      message: "Message of the invitation",
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsDetectiveMemberExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `accountId` - (Required) AWS account ID for the account.
* `emailAddress` - (Required) Email address for the account.
* `graphArn` - (Required) ARN of the behavior graph to invite the member accounts to contribute their data to.
* `message` - (Optional) A custom message to include in the invitation. Amazon Detective adds this message to the standard content that it sends for an invitation.
* `disableEmailNotification` - (Optional) If set to true, then the root user of the invited account will _not_ receive an email notification. This notification is in addition to an alert that the root user receives in AWS Personal Health Dashboard. By default, this is set to `false`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - Unique identifier (ID) of the Detective.
* `status` - Current membership status of the member account.
* `administratorId` - AWS account ID for the administrator account.
* `volumeUsageInBytes` - Data volume in bytes per day for the member account.
* `invitedTime` - Date and time, in UTC and extended RFC 3339 format, when an Amazon Detective membership invitation was last sent to the account.
* `updatedTime` - Date and time, in UTC and extended RFC 3339 format, of the most recent change to the member account's status.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `awsDetectiveMember` using the ARN of the graph followed by the account ID of the member account. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import `awsDetectiveMember` using the ARN of the graph followed by the account ID of the member account. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_detective_member.example arn:aws:detective:us-east-1:123456789101:graph:231684d34gh74g4bae1dbc7bd807d02d/123456789012
```
