# Resource: aws_appmesh_virtual_node

Provides an AWS App Mesh virtual node resource.

## Breaking Changes

Because of backward incompatible API changes (read [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-app-mesh-examples/issues/92)), `awsAppmeshVirtualNode` resource definitions created with provider versions earlier than v2.3.0 will need to be modified:

* Rename the `serviceName` attribute of the `dns` object to `hostname`.

* Replace the `backends` attribute of the `spec` object with one or more `backend` configuration blocks,
setting `virtual_service_name` to the name of the service.

The Terraform state associated with existing resources will automatically be migrated.

## Example Usage

### Basic

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import App Mesh virtual nodes using `meshName` together with the virtual node's `name`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import App Mesh virtual nodes using `meshName` together with the virtual node's `name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_appmesh_virtual_node.serviceb1 simpleapp/serviceBv1
```
