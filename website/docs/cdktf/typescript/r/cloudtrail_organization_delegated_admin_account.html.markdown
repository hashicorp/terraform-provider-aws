* `accountId` - (Required) An organization member account ID that you want to designate as a delegated administrator.

## Attribute Reference

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import delegated administrators using the delegate account `id`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { CloudtrailOrganizationDelegatedAdminAccount } from "./.gen/providers/aws/cloudtrail-organization-delegated-admin-account";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    CloudtrailOrganizationDelegatedAdminAccount.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "12345678901"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import delegated administrators using the delegate account `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_cloudtrail_organization_delegated_admin_account.example 12345678901
```
