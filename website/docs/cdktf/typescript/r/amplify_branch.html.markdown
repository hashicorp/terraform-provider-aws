# Resource: aws_amplify_branch

Provides an Amplify Branch resource.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { AmplifyApp } from "./.gen/providers/aws/amplify-app";
import { AmplifyBranch } from "./.gen/providers/aws/amplify-branch";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new AmplifyApp(this, "example", {
      name: "app",
    });
    new AmplifyBranch(this, "master", {
      appId: example.id,
      branchName: "master",
      environmentVariables: {
        REACT_APP_API_SERVER: "https://api.example.com",
      },
      framework: "React",
      stage: "PRODUCTION",
    });
  }
}

```

### Basic Authentication

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Fn, Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { AmplifyApp } from "./.gen/providers/aws/amplify-app";
import { AmplifyBranch } from "./.gen/providers/aws/amplify-branch";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new AmplifyApp(this, "example", {
      name: "app",
    });
    new AmplifyBranch(this, "master", {
      appId: example.id,
      basicAuthCredentials: Token.asString(
        Fn.base64encode("username:password")
      ),
      branchName: "master",
      enableBasicAuth: true,
    });
  }
}

```

### Notifications

Amplify Console uses EventBridge (formerly known as CloudWatch Events) and SNS for email notifications.  To implement the same functionality, you need to set `enableNotification` in a `awsAmplifyBranch` resource, as well as creating an EventBridge Rule, an SNS topic, and SNS subscriptions.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Amplify branch using `appId` and `branchName`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Amplify branch using `appId` and `branchName`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_amplify_branch.master d2ypk4k47z8u6/master
```
