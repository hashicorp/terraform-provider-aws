# Resource: aws_elb_attachment

Attaches an EC2 instance to an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). For attaching resources with Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB), see the [`aws_lb_target_group_attachment` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/lb_target_group_attachment.html).

~> **NOTE on ELB Instances and ELB Attachments:** Terraform currently provides
both a standalone ELB Attachment resource (describing an instance attached to
an ELB), and an [Elastic Load Balancer resource](elb.html) with
`instances` defined in-line. At this time you cannot use an ELB with in-line
instances in conjunction with an ELB Attachment resource. Doing so will cause a
conflict and will overwrite attachments.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ElbAttachment } from "./.gen/providers/aws/elb-attachment";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new ElbAttachment(this, "baz", {
      elb: bar.id,
      instance: foo.id,
    });
  }
}

```
