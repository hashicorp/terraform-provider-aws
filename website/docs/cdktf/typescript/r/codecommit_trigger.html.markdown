# Resource: aws_codecommit_trigger

Provides a CodeCommit Trigger Resource.

~> **NOTE:** Terraform currently can create only one trigger per repository, even if multiple aws_codecommit_trigger resources are defined. Moreover, creating triggers with Terraform will delete all other triggers in the repository (also manually-created triggers).

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { CodecommitRepository } from "./.gen/providers/aws/codecommit-repository";
import { CodecommitTrigger } from "./.gen/providers/aws/codecommit-trigger";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const test = new CodecommitRepository(this, "test", {
      repositoryName: "test",
    });
    const awsCodecommitTriggerTest = new CodecommitTrigger(this, "test_1", {
      repositoryName: test.repositoryName,
      trigger: [
        {
          destinationArn: Token.asString(awsSnsTopicTest.arn),
          events: ["all"],
          name: "all",
        },
      ],
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsCodecommitTriggerTest.overrideLogicalId("test");
  }
}

```
