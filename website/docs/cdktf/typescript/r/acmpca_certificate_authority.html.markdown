# Resource: aws_acmpca_certificate_authority

Provides a resource to manage AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authorities (ACM PCA Certificate Authorities).

~> **NOTE:** Creating this resource will leave the certificate authority in a `PENDING_CERTIFICATE` status, which means it cannot yet issue certificates. To complete this setup, you must fully sign the certificate authority CSR available in the `certificateSigningRequest` attribute. The [`aws_acmpca_certificate_authority_certificate`](/docs/providers/aws/r/acmpca_certificate_authority_certificate.html) resource can be used for this purpose.

## Example Usage

### Basic

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { AcmpcaCertificateAuthority } from "./.gen/providers/aws/acmpca-certificate-authority";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new AcmpcaCertificateAuthority(this, "example", {
      certificateAuthorityConfiguration: {
        keyAlgorithm: "RSA_4096",
        signingAlgorithm: "SHA512WITHRSA",
        subject: {
          commonName: "example.com",
        },
      },
      permanentDeletionTimeInDays: 7,
    });
  }
}

```

### Short-lived certificate

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { AcmpcaCertificateAuthority } from "./.gen/providers/aws/acmpca-certificate-authority";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new AcmpcaCertificateAuthority(this, "example", {
      certificateAuthorityConfiguration: {
        keyAlgorithm: "RSA_4096",
        signingAlgorithm: "SHA512WITHRSA",
        subject: {

        },
      },
      usageMode: "SHORT_LIVED_CERTIFICATE",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `certificateAuthorityConfiguration` - (Required) Nested argument containing algorithms and certificate subject information. Defined below.
* `enabled` - (Optional) Whether the certificate authority is enabled or disabled. Defaults to `true`. Can only be disabled if the CA is in an `ACTIVE` state.
* `revocationConfiguration` - (Optional) Nested argument containing revocation configuration. Defined below.
* `usageMode` - (Optional) Specifies whether the CA issues general-purpose certificates that typically require a revocation mechanism, or short-lived certificates that may optionally omit revocation because they expire quickly. Short-lived certificate validity is limited to seven days. Defaults to `GENERAL_PURPOSE`. Valid values: `GENERAL_PURPOSE` and `SHORT_LIVED_CERTIFICATE`.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of user-defined tags that are attached to the certificate authority. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `type` - (Optional) Type of the certificate authority. Defaults to `SUBORDINATE`. Valid values: `ROOT` and `SUBORDINATE`.

* `title` - (Optional) Title such as Mr. or Ms. which is pre-pended to the name to refer formally to the certificate subject. Must be less than or equal to 64 characters in length.

### revocation_configuration

* `crlConfiguration` - (Optional) Nested argument containing configuration of the certificate revocation list (CRL), if any, maintained by the certificate authority. Defined below.
* `ocspConfiguration` - (Optional) Nested argument containing configuration of
the custom OCSP responder endpoint. Defined below.

#### crl_configuration

If you do not provide a value for the `customCname` argument, the name of your S3 bucket is placed into the CRL Distribution Points extension of the issued certificate. You must specify a bucket policy that allows ACM PCA to write the CRL to your bucket. Must be between 3 and 255 characters in length.
* `s3ObjectAcl` - (Optional) Determines whether the CRL will be publicly readable or privately held in the CRL Amazon S3 bucket. Defaults to `PUBLIC_READ`.

#### ocsp_configuration

* `enabled` - (Required) Boolean value that specifies whether a custom OCSP responder is enabled.
* `ocspCustomCname` - (Optional) CNAME specifying a customized OCSP domain. Note: The value of the CNAME must not include a protocol prefix such as "http://" or "https://".

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - ARN of the certificate authority.
* `certificate` - Base64-encoded certificate authority (CA) certificate. Only available after the certificate authority certificate has been imported.
* `certificateChain` - Base64-encoded certificate chain that includes any intermediate certificates and chains up to root on-premises certificate that you used to sign your private CA certificate. The chain does not include your private CA certificate. Only available after the certificate authority certificate has been imported.

* `tagsAll` - Map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `create` - (Default `1m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_acmpca_certificate_authority` using the certificate authority ARN. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { AcmpcaCertificateAuthority } from "./.gen/providers/aws/acmpca-certificate-authority";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    AcmpcaCertificateAuthority.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "arn:aws:acm-pca:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_acmpca_certificate_authority` using the certificate authority ARN. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_acmpca_certificate_authority.example arn:aws:acm-pca:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
```
