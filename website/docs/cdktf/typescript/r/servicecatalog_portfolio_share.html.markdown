# Resource: aws_servicecatalog_portfolio_share

Manages a Service Catalog Portfolio Share. Shares the specified portfolio with the specified account or organization node. You can share portfolios to an organization, an organizational unit, or a specific account.

If the portfolio share with the specified account or organization node already exists, using this resource to re-create the share will have no effect and will not return an error. You can then use this resource to update the share.

~> **NOTE:** Shares to an organization node can only be created by the management account of an organization or by a delegated administrator. If a delegated admin is de-registered, they can no longer create portfolio shares.

~> **NOTE:** AWSOrganizationsAccess must be enabled in order to create a portfolio share to an organization node.

~> **NOTE:** You can't share a shared resource, including portfolios that contain a shared product.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_servicecatalog_portfolio_share` using the portfolio share ID. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ServicecatalogPortfolioShare } from "./.gen/providers/aws/servicecatalog-portfolio-share";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    ServicecatalogPortfolioShare.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "port-12344321:ACCOUNT:123456789012"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_servicecatalog_portfolio_share` using the portfolio share ID. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_servicecatalog_portfolio_share.example port-12344321:ACCOUNT:123456789012
