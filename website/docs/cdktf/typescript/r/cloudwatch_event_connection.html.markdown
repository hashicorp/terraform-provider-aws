# Resource: aws_cloudwatch_event_connection

Provides an EventBridge connection resource.

~> **Note:** EventBridge was formerly known as CloudWatch Events. The functionality is identical.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { CloudwatchEventConnection } from "./.gen/providers/aws/cloudwatch-event-connection";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new CloudwatchEventConnection(this, "test", {
      authParameters: {
        apiKey: {
          key: "x-signature",
          value: "1234",
        },
      },
      authorizationType: "API_KEY",
      description: "A connection description",
      name: "ngrok-connection",
    });

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import EventBridge connection using the `name`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { CloudwatchEventConnection } from "./.gen/providers/aws/cloudwatch-event-connection";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    CloudwatchEventConnection.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "test",
      "ngrok-connection"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import EventBridge EventBridge connection using the `name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_cloudwatch_event_connection.test ngrok-connection
```
