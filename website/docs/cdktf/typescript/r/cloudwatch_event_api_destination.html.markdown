 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { CloudwatchEventApiDestination } from "./.gen/providers/aws/cloudwatch-event-api-destination";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new CloudwatchEventApiDestination(this, "test", {
      connectionArn: Token.asString(awsCloudwatchEventConnectionTest.arn),
      description: "An API Destination",
      httpMethod: "POST",
      invocationEndpoint: "https://api.destination.com/endpoint",
      invocationRateLimitPerSecond: 20,

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import EventBridge API Destinations using the `name`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { CloudwatchEventApiDestination } from "./.gen/providers/aws/cloudwatch-event-api-destination";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    CloudwatchEventApiDestination.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "test",
      "api-destination"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import EventBridge API Destinations using the `name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_cloudwatch_event_api_destination.test api-destination
```
