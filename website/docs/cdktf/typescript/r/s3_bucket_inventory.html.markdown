# Resource: aws_s3_bucket_inventory

Provides a S3 bucket [inventory configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-inventory.html) resource.

## Example Usage

### Add inventory configuration

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { S3Bucket } from "./.gen/providers/aws/s3-bucket";
import { S3BucketInventory } from "./.gen/providers/aws/s3-bucket-inventory";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const inventory = new S3Bucket(this, "inventory", {
      bucket: "my-tf-inventory-bucket",
    });
    const test = new S3Bucket(this, "test", {
      bucket: "my-tf-test-bucket",
    });
    const awsS3BucketInventoryTest = new S3BucketInventory(this, "test_2", {
      bucket: test.id,
      destination: {
        bucket: {
          bucketArn: inventory.arn,
          format: "ORC",
        },
      },
      includedObjectVersions: "All",
      name: "EntireBucketDaily",
      schedule: {
        frequency: "Daily",
      },
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsS3BucketInventoryTest.overrideLogicalId("test");
  }
}

```

### Add inventory configuration with S3 object prefix

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { S3Bucket } from "./.gen/providers/aws/s3-bucket";
import { S3BucketInventory } from "./.gen/providers/aws/s3-bucket-inventory";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const inventory = new S3Bucket(this, "inventory", {
      bucket: "my-tf-inventory-bucket",
    });
    const test = new S3Bucket(this, "test", {
      bucket: "my-tf-test-bucket",
    });
    new S3BucketInventory(this, "test-prefix", {
      bucket: test.id,
      destination: {
        bucket: {
          bucketArn: inventory.arn,
          format: "ORC",
          prefix: "inventory",
        },
      },
      filter: {
        prefix: "documents/",
      },
      includedObjectVersions: "All",
      name: "DocumentsWeekly",
      schedule: {
        frequency: "Daily",
      },
    });
  }
}

```

* `format` - (Required) Specifies the output format of the inventory results. Can be `CSV`, [`ORC`](https://orc.apache.org/) or [`Parquet`](https://parquet.apache.org/).
* `accountId` - (Optional) ID of the account that owns the destination bucket. Recommended to be set to prevent problems if the destination bucket ownership changes.
* `prefix` - (Optional) Prefix that is prepended to all inventory results.
* `encryption` - (Optional) Contains the type of server-side encryption to use to encrypt the inventory (documented below).

The `encryption` configuration supports the following:

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports no additional attributes.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import S3 bucket inventory configurations using `bucket:inventory`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import S3 bucket inventory configurations using `bucket:inventory`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_inventory.my-bucket-entire-bucket my-bucket:EntireBucket
```
