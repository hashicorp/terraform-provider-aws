# Resource: aws_chime_voice_connector

Enables you to connect your phone system to the telephone network at a substantial cost savings by using SIP trunking.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ChimeVoiceConnector } from "./.gen/providers/aws/chime-voice-connector";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new ChimeVoiceConnector(this, "test", {
      awsRegion: "us-east-1",
      name: "connector-test-1",
      requireEncryption: true,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the Amazon Chime Voice Connector.
* `requireEncryption` - (Required) When enabled, requires encryption for the Amazon Chime Voice Connector.

The following arguments are optional:

* `awsRegion` - (Optional) The AWS Region in which the Amazon Chime Voice Connector is created. Default value: `us-east-1`
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value mapping of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the Amazon Chime Voice Connector.
* `outboundHostName` - The outbound host name for the Amazon Chime Voice Connector.
* `tagsAll` - Map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Configuration Recorder using the name. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ChimeVoiceConnector } from "./.gen/providers/aws/chime-voice-connector";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    ChimeVoiceConnector.generateConfigForImport(this, "test", "example");
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Configuration Recorder using the name. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_chime_voice_connector.test example
```
