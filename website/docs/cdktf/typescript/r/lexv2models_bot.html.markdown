Terraform resource for managing an AWS Lex V2 Models Bot.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript

import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Fn, Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { IamRole } from "./.gen/providers/aws/iam-role";
import { Lexv2ModelsBot } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lexv2-models-bot";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new IamRole(this, "example", {
      assumeRolePolicy: Token.asString(
        Fn.jsonencode({
          Statement: [
            {
              Action: "sts:AssumeRole",
              Effect: "Allow",
              Principal: {
                Service: "lexv2.amazonaws.com",

          ],

      name: "example",
      tags: {
        created_by: "aws",
      },
    });
    const awsLexv2ModelsBotExample = new Lexv2ModelsBot(this, "example_1", {
      dataPrivacy: [
        {
          childDirected: false,
        },
      ],
      description: "Example description",
      idleSessionTtlInSeconds: 60,
      name: "example",
      roleArn: example.arn,
      tags: {
        foo: "bar",
      },
      type: "Bot",
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsLexv2ModelsBotExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Lex V2 Models Bot using the `id`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Lexv2ModelsBot } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lexv2-models-bot";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    Lexv2ModelsBot.generateConfigForImport(this, "example", "bot-id-12345678");
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Lex V2 Models Bot using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_lexv2models_bot.example bot-id-12345678
```
