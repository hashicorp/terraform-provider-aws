# Resource: aws_appmesh_gateway_route

Provides an AWS App Mesh gateway route resource.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { AppmeshGatewayRoute } from "./.gen/providers/aws/appmesh-gateway-route";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new AppmeshGatewayRoute(this, "example", {
      meshName: "example-service-mesh",
      name: "example-gateway-route",
      spec: {
        httpRoute: {
          action: {
            target: {
              virtualService: {
                virtualServiceName: Token.asString(
                  awsAppmeshVirtualServiceExample.name
                ),
              },

* `spec` - (Required) Gateway route specification to apply.
* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

The `target` object supports the following:

* `port` - (Optional) The port number that corresponds to the target for Virtual Service provider port. This is required when the provider (router or node) of the Virtual Service has multiple listeners.
* `virtualService` - (Required) Virtual service gateway route target.

The `virtualService` object supports the following:

* `virtualServiceName` - (Required) Name of the virtual service that traffic is routed to. Must be between 1 and 255 characters in length.

The `httpRoute` and `http2Route`'s `action` object additionally supports the following:

* `rewrite` - (Optional) Gateway route action to rewrite.

The `rewrite` object supports the following:

The `prefix` object supports the following:

* `defaultPrefix` - (Optional) Default prefix used to replace the incoming route prefix when rewritten. Valid values: `ENABLED`, `DISABLED`.
* `value` - (Optional) Value used to replace the incoming route prefix when rewritten.

The `grpcRoute`'s `match` object supports the following:

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `lastUpdatedDate` - Last update date of the gateway route.
* `resourceOwner` - Resource owner's AWS account ID.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import App Mesh gateway routes using `meshName` and `virtualGatewayName` together with the gateway route's `name`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { AppmeshGatewayRoute } from "./.gen/providers/aws/appmesh-gateway-route";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    AppmeshGatewayRoute.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "mesh/gw1/example-gateway-route"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import App Mesh gateway routes using `meshName` and `virtualGatewayName` together with the gateway route's `name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_appmesh_gateway_route.example mesh/gw1/example-gateway-route
```
