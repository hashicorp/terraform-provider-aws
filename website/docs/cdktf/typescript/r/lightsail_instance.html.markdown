# Resource: aws_lightsail_instance

Provides a Lightsail Instance. Amazon Lightsail is a service to provide easy virtual private servers
with custom software already setup. See [What is Amazon Lightsail?](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/getting-started/article/what-is-amazon-lightsail)
for more information.

~> **Note:** Lightsail is currently only supported in a limited number of AWS Regions, please see ["Regions and Availability Zones in Amazon Lightsail"](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/overview/article/understanding-regions-and-availability-zones-in-amazon-lightsail) for more details

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LightsailInstance } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-instance";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new LightsailInstance(this, "gitlab_test", {
      availabilityZone: "us-east-1b",
      blueprintId: "amazon_linux_2",
      bundleId: "nano_1_0",
      keyPairName: "some_key_name",
      name: "custom_gitlab",
      tags: {
        foo: "bar",
      },
    });
  }
}

```

### Example With User Data

Lightsail user data is handled differently than ec2 user data. Lightsail user data only accepts a single lined string. The below example shows installing apache and creating the index page.

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LightsailInstance } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-instance";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new LightsailInstance(this, "custom", {
      availabilityZone: "us-east-1b",
      blueprintId: "amazon_linux_2",
      bundleId: "nano_1_0",
      name: "custom",
      userData:
        "sudo yum install -y httpd && sudo systemctl start httpd && sudo systemctl enable httpd && echo '<h1>Deployed via Terraform</h1>' | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html",
    });
  }
}

```

### Enable Auto Snapshots

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LightsailInstance } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-instance";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new LightsailInstance(this, "test", {
      addOn: {
        snapshotTime: "06:00",
        status: "Enabled",
        type: "AutoSnapshot",
      },
      availabilityZone: "us-east-1b",
      blueprintId: "amazon_linux_2",
      bundleId: "nano_1_0",
      name: "custom_instance",
      tags: {
        foo: "bar",
      },
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the Lightsail Instance. Names be unique within each AWS Region in your Lightsail account.
* `availabilityZone` - (Required) The Availability Zone in which to create your
instance (see list below)
* `blueprintId` - (Required) The ID for a virtual private server image. A list of available blueprint IDs can be obtained using the AWS CLI command: `aws lightsail get-blueprints`
* `bundleId` - (Required) The bundle of specification information (see list below)
* `keyPairName` - (Optional) The name of your key pair. Created in the
Lightsail console (cannot use `aws_key_pair` at this time)
* `userData` - (Optional) Single lined launch script as a string to configure server with additional user data
* `ipAddressType` - (Optional) The IP address type of the Lightsail Instance. Valid Values: `dualstack` | `ipv4`.
* `addOn` - (Optional) The add on configuration for the instance. [Detailed below](#add_on).
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. To create a key-only tag, use an empty string as the value. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

### `addOn`

Defines the add on configuration for the instance. The `addOn` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `type` - (Required) The add-on type. There is currently only one valid type `AutoSnapshot`.
* `snapshotTime` - (Required) The daily time when an automatic snapshot will be created. Must be in HH:00 format, and in an hourly increment and specified in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The snapshot will be automatically created between the time specified and up to 45 minutes after.
* `status` - (Required) The status of the add on. Valid Values: `Enabled`, `Disabled`.

* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Lightsail Instances using their name. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Lightsail Instances using their name. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_lightsail_instance.gitlab_test 'custom_gitlab'
```
