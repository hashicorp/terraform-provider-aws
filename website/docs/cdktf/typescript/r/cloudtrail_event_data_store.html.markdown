# Resource: aws_cloudtrail_event_data_store

Provides a CloudTrail Event Data Store.

More information about event data stores can be found in the [Event Data Store User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/query-event-data-store.html).

-> **Tip:** For an organization event data store you must create this resource in the management account.

## Example Usage

### Basic

The most simple event data store configuration requires us to only set the `name` attribute. The event data store will automatically capture all management events. To capture management events from all the regions, `multiRegionEnabled` must be `true`.

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { CloudtrailEventDataStore } from "./.gen/providers/aws/cloudtrail-event-data-store";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new CloudtrailEventDataStore(this, "example", {
      name: "example-event-data-store",
    });
  }
}

```

### Data Event Logging

CloudTrail can log [Data Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html) for certain services such as S3 bucket objects and Lambda function invocations. Additional information about data event configuration can be found in the following links:

#### Log all DynamoDB PutEvent actions for a specific DynamoDB table

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { CloudtrailEventDataStore } from "./.gen/providers/aws/cloudtrail-event-data-store";
import { DataAwsDynamodbTable } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-dynamodb-table";
interface MyConfig {
  name: any;
}
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string, config: MyConfig) {
    super(scope, name);
    const table = new DataAwsDynamodbTable(this, "table", {
      name: "not-important-dynamodb-table",
    });
    new CloudtrailEventDataStore(this, "example", {
      advancedEventSelector: [
        {
          fieldSelector: [
            {
              equalTo: ["Data"],
              field: "eventCategory",
            },
            {
              equalTo: ["AWS::DynamoDB::Table"],
              field: "resources.type",
            },
            {
              equalTo: ["PutItem"],
              field: "eventName",
            },
            {
              equalTo: [Token.asString(table.arn)],
              field: "resources.ARN",
            },
          ],
          name: "Log all DynamoDB PutEvent actions for a specific DynamoDB table",
        },
      ],
      name: config.name,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

- `name` - (Required) The name of the event data store.
- `advancedEventSelector` - (Optional) The advanced event selectors to use to select the events for the data store. For more information about how to use advanced event selectors, see [Log events by using advanced event selectors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html#creating-data-event-selectors-advanced) in the CloudTrail User Guide.
- `multiRegionEnabled` - (Optional) Specifies whether the event data store includes events from all regions, or only from the region in which the event data store is created. Default: `true`.
- `organizationEnabled` - (Optional) Specifies whether an event data store collects events logged for an organization in AWS Organizations. Default: `false`.
- `retentionPeriod` - (Optional) The retention period of the event data store, in days. You can set a retention period of up to 2555 days, the equivalent of seven years. Default: `2555`.
- `kmsKeyId` - Specifies the AWS KMS key ID to use to encrypt the events delivered by CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by alias/, a fully specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally unique identifier.
- `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
- `terminationProtectionEnabled` - (Optional) Specifies whether termination protection is enabled for the event data store. If termination protection is enabled, you cannot delete the event data store until termination protection is disabled. Default: `true`.

### Advanced Event Selector Arguments

`advancedEventSelector` supports the following arguments:

- `name` (Optional) - Specifies the name of the advanced event selector.
- `fieldSelector` (Required) - Specifies the selector statements in an advanced event selector. Fields documented below.

#### Field Selector Arguments

`fieldSelector` supports the following arguments:

- `field` (Required) - Specifies a field in an event record on which to filter events to be logged. You can specify only the following values: `readOnly`, `eventSource`, `eventName`, `eventCategory`, `resources.type`, `resources.ARN`.
- `equals` (Optional) - A list of values that includes events that match the exact value of the event record field specified as the value of `field`. This is the only valid operator that you can use with the `readOnly`, `eventCategory`, and `resources.type` fields.
- `notEquals` (Optional) - A list of values that excludes events that match the exact value of the event record field specified as the value of `field`.
- `startsWith` (Optional) - A list of values that includes events that match the first few characters of the event record field specified as the value of `field`.
- `notStartsWith` (Optional) - A list of values that excludes events that match the first few characters of the event record field specified as the value of `field`.
- `endsWith` (Optional) - A list of values that includes events that match the last few characters of the event record field specified as the value of `field`.
- `notEndsWith` (Optional) - A list of values that excludes events that match the last few characters of the event record field specified as the value of `field`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

- `arn` - ARN of the event data store.
- `id` - Name of the event data store.
- `tagsAll` - Map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import event data stores using their `arn`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import event data stores using their `arn`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_cloudtrail_event_data_store.example arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-1:123456789123:eventdatastore/22333815-4414-412c-b155-dd254033gfhf
```
