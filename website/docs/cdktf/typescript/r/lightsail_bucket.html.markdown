# Resource: aws_lightsail_bucket

Provides a lightsail bucket.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LightsailBucket } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-bucket";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new LightsailBucket(this, "test", {
      bundleId: "small_1_0",
      name: "mytestbucket",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) The name for the bucket.
* `bundleId` - (Required) - The ID of the bundle to use for the bucket. A bucket bundle specifies the monthly cost, storage space, and data transfer quota for a bucket. Use the [get-bucket-bundles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lightsail/get-bucket-bundles.html) cli command to get a list of bundle IDs that you can specify.
* `forceDelete` - (Optional) - Force Delete non-empty buckets using `terraform destroy`. AWS by default will not delete an s3 bucket which is not empty, to prevent losing bucket data and affecting other resources in lightsail. If `forceDelete` is set to `true` the bucket will be deleted even when not empty.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. To create a key-only tag, use an empty string as the value. If configured with a provider `defaultTags` configuration block present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The name used for this bucket (matches `name`).
* `arn` - The ARN of the lightsail bucket.
* `availabilityZone` - The resource Availability Zone. Follows the format us-east-2a (case-sensitive).
* `createdAt` - The timestamp when the bucket was created.
* `region` - The Amazon Web Services Region name.
* `supportCode` - The support code for the resource. Include this code in your email to support when you have questions about a resource in Lightsail. This code enables our support team to look up your Lightsail information more easily.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider `defaultTags` configuration block.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_lightsail_bucket` using the `name` attribute. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LightsailBucket } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-bucket";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    LightsailBucket.generateConfigForImport(this, "test", "example-bucket");
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_lightsail_bucket` using the `name` attribute. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_lightsail_bucket.test example-bucket
```
