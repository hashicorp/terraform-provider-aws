# Resource: aws_directory_service_log_subscription

Provides a Log subscription for AWS Directory Service that pushes logs to cloudwatch.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { CloudwatchLogGroup } from "./.gen/providers/aws/cloudwatch-log-group";
import { CloudwatchLogResourcePolicy } from "./.gen/providers/aws/cloudwatch-log-resource-policy";
import { DataAwsIamPolicyDocument } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-iam-policy-document";
import { DirectoryServiceLogSubscription } from "./.gen/providers/aws/directory-service-log-subscription";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new CloudwatchLogGroup(this, "example", {
      name:
        "/aws/directoryservice/${" +
        awsDirectoryServiceDirectoryExample.id +
        "}",
      retentionInDays: 14,
    });
    const awsDirectoryServiceLogSubscriptionExample =
      new DirectoryServiceLogSubscription(this, "example_1", {
        directoryId: Token.asString(awsDirectoryServiceDirectoryExample.id),
        logGroupName: example.name,
      });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsDirectoryServiceLogSubscriptionExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
    const adLogPolicy = new DataAwsIamPolicyDocument(this, "ad-log-policy", {
      statement: [
        {
          actions: ["logs:CreateLogStream", "logs:PutLogEvents"],
          effect: "Allow",
          principals: [
            {
              identifiers: ["ds.amazonaws.com"],
              type: "Service",
            },
          ],
          resources: ["${" + example.arn + "}:*"],
        },
      ],
    });
    const awsCloudwatchLogResourcePolicyAdLogPolicy =
      new CloudwatchLogResourcePolicy(this, "ad-log-policy_3", {
        policyDocument: Token.asString(adLogPolicy.json),
        policyName: "ad-log-policy",
      });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsCloudwatchLogResourcePolicyAdLogPolicy.overrideLogicalId(
      "ad-log-policy"
    );
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `directoryId` - (Required) ID of directory.
* `logGroupName` - (Required) Name of the cloudwatch log group to which the logs should be published. The log group should be already created and the directory service principal should be provided with required permission to create stream and publish logs. Changing this value would delete the current subscription and create a new one. A directory can only have one log subscription at a time.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports no additional attributes.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Directory Service Log Subscriptions using the directory id. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DirectoryServiceLogSubscription } from "./.gen/providers/aws/directory-service-log-subscription";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    DirectoryServiceLogSubscription.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "msad",
      "d-1234567890"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Directory Service Log Subscriptions using the directory id. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_directory_service_log_subscription.msad d-1234567890
```
