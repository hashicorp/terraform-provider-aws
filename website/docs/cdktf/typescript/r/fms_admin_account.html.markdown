import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { FmsAdminAccount } from "./.gen/providers/aws/fms-admin-account";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {

    FmsAdminAccount.generateConfigForImport(this, "example", "123456789012");
