# Resource: aws_chime_voice_connector_group

Creates an Amazon Chime Voice Connector group under the administrator's AWS account. You can associate Amazon Chime Voice Connectors with the Amazon Chime Voice Connector group by including VoiceConnectorItems in the request.

You can include Amazon Chime Voice Connectors from different AWS Regions in your group. This creates a fault tolerant mechanism for fallback in case of availability events.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ChimeVoiceConnector } from "./.gen/providers/aws/chime-voice-connector";
import { ChimeVoiceConnectorGroup } from "./.gen/providers/aws/chime-voice-connector-group";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const vc1 = new ChimeVoiceConnector(this, "vc1", {
      awsRegion: "us-east-1",
      name: "connector-test-1",
      requireEncryption: true,
    });
    const vc2 = new ChimeVoiceConnector(this, "vc2", {
      awsRegion: "us-west-2",
      name: "connector-test-2",
      requireEncryption: true,
    });
    new ChimeVoiceConnectorGroup(this, "group", {
      connector: [
        {
          priority: 1,
          voiceConnectorId: vc1.id,
        },
        {
          priority: 3,
          voiceConnectorId: vc2.id,
        },
      ],
      name: "test-group",
    });
  }
}

```

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Configuration Recorder using the name. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ChimeVoiceConnectorGroup } from "./.gen/providers/aws/chime-voice-connector-group";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    ChimeVoiceConnectorGroup.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "default",
      "example"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Configuration Recorder using the name. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_chime_voice_connector_group.default example
```
