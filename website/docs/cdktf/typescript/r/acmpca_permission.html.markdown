# Resource: aws_acmpca_permission

Provides a resource to manage an AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authorities Permission.
Currently, this is only required in order to allow the ACM service to automatically renew certificates issued by a PCA.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { AcmpcaCertificateAuthority } from "./.gen/providers/aws/acmpca-certificate-authority";
import { AcmpcaPermission } from "./.gen/providers/aws/acmpca-permission";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new AcmpcaCertificateAuthority(this, "example", {
      certificateAuthorityConfiguration: {
        keyAlgorithm: "RSA_4096",
        signingAlgorithm: "SHA512WITHRSA",
        subject: {
          commonName: "example.com",
        },
      },
    });
    const awsAcmpcaPermissionExample = new AcmpcaPermission(this, "example_1", {
      actions: ["IssueCertificate", "GetCertificate", "ListPermissions"],
      certificateAuthorityArn: example.arn,
      principal: "acm.amazonaws.com",
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsAcmpcaPermissionExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `certificateAuthorityArn` - (Required) ARN of the CA that grants the permissions.
* `actions` - (Required) Actions that the specified AWS service principal can use. These include `IssueCertificate`, `GetCertificate`, and `ListPermissions`. Note that in order for ACM to automatically rotate certificates issued by a PCA, it must be granted permission on all 3 actions, as per the example above.
* `principal` - (Required) AWS service or identity that receives the permission. At this time, the only valid principal is `acm.amazonaws.com`.
* `sourceAccount` - (Optional) ID of the calling account
