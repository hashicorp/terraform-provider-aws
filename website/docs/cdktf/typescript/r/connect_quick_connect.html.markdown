## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Amazon Connect Quick Connects using the `instanceId` and `quickConnectId` separated by a colon (`:`). For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ConnectQuickConnect } from "./.gen/providers/aws/connect-quick-connect";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    ConnectQuickConnect.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "f1288a1f-6193-445a-b47e-af739b2:c1d4e5f6-1b3c-1b3c-1b3c-c1d4e5f6c1d4e5"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Amazon Connect Quick Connects using the `instanceId` and `quickConnectId` separated by a colon (`:`). For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_connect_quick_connect.example f1288a1f-6193-445a-b47e-af739b2:c1d4e5f6-1b3c-1b3c-1b3c-c1d4e5f6c1d4e5
