## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import QuickSight Group membership using the AWS account ID, namespace, group name and member name separated by `/`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { QuicksightGroupMembership } from "./.gen/providers/aws/quicksight-group-membership";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    QuicksightGroupMembership.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "123456789123/default/all-access-users/john_smith"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import QuickSight Group membership using the AWS account ID, namespace, group name and member name separated by `/`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_quicksight_group_membership.example 123456789123/default/all-access-users/john_smith
```
