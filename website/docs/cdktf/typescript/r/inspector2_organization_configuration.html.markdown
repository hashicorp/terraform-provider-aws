### Basic Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Inspector2OrganizationConfiguration } from "./.gen/providers/aws/inspector2-organization-configuration";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new Inspector2OrganizationConfiguration(this, "example", {
      autoEnable: {
        ec2: true,
        ecr: false,
        lambda: true,
        lambdaCode: true,
      },
    });

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

### `autoEnable`

* `ecr` - (Required) Whether Amazon ECR scans are automatically enabled for new members of your Amazon Inspector organization.
* `lambda` - (Optional) Whether Lambda Function scans are automatically enabled for new members of your Amazon Inspector organization.
