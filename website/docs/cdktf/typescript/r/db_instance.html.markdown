# Resource: aws_db_instance

Provides an RDS instance resource.  A DB instance is an isolated database
environment in the cloud.  A DB instance can contain multiple user-created
databases.

Changes to a DB instance can occur when you manually change a parameter, such as
`allocatedStorage`, and are reflected in the next maintenance window. Because
of this, Terraform may report a difference in its planning phase because a
modification has not yet taken place. You can use the `applyImmediately` flag
to instruct the service to apply the change immediately (see documentation
below).

When upgrading the major version of an engine, `allowMajorVersionUpgrade` must be set to `true`.

~> **Note:** using `applyImmediately` can result in a brief downtime as the server reboots.
See the AWS Docs on [RDS Instance Maintenance][instance-maintenance] for more information.

~> **Note:** All arguments including the username and password will be stored in the raw state as plain-text.
[Read more about sensitive data instate](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).

## RDS Instance Class Types

Amazon RDS supports instance classes for the following use cases: General-purpose, Memory-optimized, Burstable Performance, and Optimized-reads.
For more information please read the AWS RDS documentation about [DB Instance Class Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html)

## Low-Downtime Updates

By default, RDS applies updates to DB Instances in-place, which can lead to service interruptions.
Low-downtime updates minimize service interruptions by performing the updates with an [RDS Blue/Green deployment][blue-green] and switching over the instances when complete.

Low-downtime updates are only available for DB Instances using MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL,
as other engines are not supported by RDS Blue/Green deployments.
They cannot be used with DB Instances with replicas.

Backups must be enabled to use low-downtime updates.

Enable low-downtime updates by setting `blue_green_update.enabled` to `true`.

### Storage Autoscaling

To enable Storage Autoscaling with instances that support the feature, define the `maxAllocatedStorage` argument higher than the `allocatedStorage` argument. Terraform will automatically hide differences with the `allocatedStorage` argument value if autoscaling occurs.

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DbInstance } from "./.gen/providers/aws/db-instance";
interface MyConfig {
  instanceClass: any;
}
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string, config: MyConfig) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DbInstance(this, "example", {
      allocatedStorage: 50,
      maxAllocatedStorage: 100,
      instanceClass: config.instanceClass,
    });
  }
}

```

If `maxAllocatedStorage` is configured, this argument represents the initial storage allocation and differences from the configuration will be ignored automatically when Storage Autoscaling occurs. If `replicateSourceDb` is set, the value is ignored during the creation of the instance.
* `allowMajorVersionUpgrade` - (Optional) Indicates that major version
upgrades are allowed. Changing this parameter does not result in an outage and
the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.
* `applyImmediately` - (Optional) Specifies whether any database modifications
are applied immediately, or during the next maintenance window. Default is
`false`. See [Amazon RDS Documentation for more
information.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.html)

* `monitoringInterval` - (Optional) The interval, in seconds, between points
when Enhanced Monitoring metrics are collected for the DB instance. To disable
collecting Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0. The default is 0. Valid
Values: 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60.
* `monitoringRoleArn` - (Optional) The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS
to send enhanced monitoring metrics to CloudWatch Logs. You can find more
information on the [AWS
Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.html)
what IAM permissions are needed to allow Enhanced Monitoring for RDS Instances.

is provided or `manageMasterUserPassword` is set.) Password for the master DB user. Note that this may show up in
logs, and it will be stored in the state file. Cannot be set if `manageMasterUserPassword` is set to `true`.
* `performanceInsightsEnabled` - (Optional) Specifies whether Performance Insights are enabled. Defaults to false.
* `performanceInsightsKmsKeyId` - (Optional) The ARN for the KMS key to encrypt Performance Insights data. When specifying `performanceInsightsKmsKeyId`, `performanceInsightsEnabled` needs to be set to true. Once KMS key is set, it can never be changed.
* `performanceInsightsRetentionPeriod` - (Optional) Amount of time in days to retain Performance Insights data. Valid values are `7`, `731` (2 years) or a multiple of `31`. When specifying `performanceInsightsRetentionPeriod`, `performanceInsightsEnabled` needs to be set to true. Defaults to '7'.
* `port` - (Optional) The port on which the DB accepts connections.
* `publiclyAccessible` - (Optional) Bool to control if instance is publicly
accessible. Default is `false`.
* `replicaMode` - (Optional) Specifies whether the replica is in either `mounted` or `open-read-only` mode. This attribute
is only supported by Oracle instances. Oracle replicas operate in `open-read-only` mode unless otherwise specified. See [Working with Oracle Read Replicas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/oracle-read-replicas.html) for more information.
* `replicateSourceDb` - (Optional) Specifies that this resource is a Replicate
database, and to use this value as the source database. This correlates to the
`identifier` of another Amazon RDS Database to replicate (if replicating within
a single region) or ARN of the Amazon RDS Database to replicate (if replicating
cross-region). Note that if you are
creating a cross-region replica of an encrypted database you will also need to
specify a `kmsKeyId`. See [DB Instance Replication][instance-replication] and [Working with
PostgreSQL and MySQL Read Replicas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html)
for more information on using Replication.
* `upgradeStorageConfig` - (Optional) Whether to upgrade the storage file system configuration on the read replica. Can only be set with `replicateSourceDb`.
* `restoreToPointInTime` - (Optional, Forces new resource) A configuration block for restoring a DB instance to an arbitrary point in time.

* `s3Import` - (Optional) Restore from a Percona Xtrabackup in S3.  See [Importing Data into an Amazon RDS MySQL DB Instance](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MySQL.Procedural.Importing.html)
* `skipFinalSnapshot` - (Optional) Determines whether a final DB snapshot is
created before the DB instance is deleted. If true is specified, no DBSnapshot
is created. If false is specified, a DB snapshot is created before the DB
instance is deleted, using the value from `finalSnapshotIdentifier`. Default
is `false`.
* `snapshotIdentifier` - (Optional) Specifies whether or not to create this
database from a snapshot. This correlates to the snapshot ID you'd find in the
RDS console, e.g: rds:production-2015-06-26-06-05.
* `storageEncrypted` - (Optional) Specifies whether the DB instance is
encrypted. Note that if you are creating a cross-region read replica this field
is ignored and you should instead declare `kmsKeyId` with a valid ARN. The
default is `false` if not specified.
* `storageType` - (Optional) One of "standard" (magnetic), "gp2" (general
purpose SSD), "gp3" (general purpose SSD that needs `iops` independently)
or "io1" (provisioned IOPS SSD). The default is "io1" if `iops` is specified,
"gp2" if not.
* `storageThroughput` - (Optional) The storage throughput value for the DB instance. Can only be set when `storageType` is `"gp3"`. Cannot be specified if the `allocatedStorage` value is below a per-`engine` threshold. See the [RDS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Storage.html#gp3-storage) for details.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `timezone` - (Optional) Time zone of the DB instance. `timezone` is currently
only supported by Microsoft SQL Server. The `timezone` can only be set on
creation. See [MSSQL User
Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SQLServer.html#SQLServer.Concepts.General.TimeZone)
for more information.
* `username` - (Required unless a `snapshotIdentifier` or `replicateSourceDb`
is provided) Username for the master DB user. Cannot be specified for a replica.
* `vpcSecurityGroupIds` - (Optional) List of VPC security groups to
associate.
* `customerOwnedIpEnabled` - (Optional) Indicates whether to enable a customer-owned IP address (CoIP) for an RDS on Outposts DB instance. See [CoIP for RDS on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-on-outposts.html#rds-on-outposts.coip) for more information.

~> **NOTE:** Removing the `replicateSourceDb` attribute from an existing RDS
Replicate database managed by Terraform will promote the database to a fully
standalone database.

### Restore To Point In Time

-> **Note:** You can restore to any point in time before the source DB instance's `latestRestorableTime` or a point up to the number of days specified in the source DB instance's `backupRetentionPeriod`.
For more information, please refer to the [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIT.html).
This setting does not apply to `aurora-mysql` or `aurora-postgresql` DB engines. For Aurora, refer to the [`aws_rds_cluster` resource documentation](/docs/providers/aws/r/rds_cluster.html#restore_in_time).

The `restoreToPointInTime` block supports the following arguments:

* `restoreTime` - (Optional) The date and time to restore from. Value must be a time in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) format and must be before the latest restorable time for the DB instance. Cannot be specified with `useLatestRestorableTime`.
* `sourceDbInstanceIdentifier` - (Optional) The identifier of the source DB instance from which to restore. Must match the identifier of an existing DB instance. Required if `sourceDbInstanceAutomatedBackupsArn` or `sourceDbiResourceId` is not specified.
* `sourceDbInstanceAutomatedBackupsArn` - (Optional) The ARN of the automated backup from which to restore. Required if `sourceDbInstanceIdentifier` or `sourceDbiResourceId` is not specified.
* `sourceDbiResourceId` - (Optional) The resource ID of the source DB instance from which to restore. Required if `sourceDbInstanceIdentifier` or `sourceDbInstanceAutomatedBackupsArn` is not specified.
* `useLatestRestorableTime` - (Optional) A boolean value that indicates whether the DB instance is restored from the latest backup time. Defaults to `false`. Cannot be specified with `restoreTime`.
