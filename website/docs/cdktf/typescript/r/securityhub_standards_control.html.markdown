# Resource: aws_securityhub_standards_control

Disable/enable Security Hub standards control in the current region.

The `aws_securityhub_standards_control` behaves differently from normal resources, in that
Terraform does not _create_ this resource, but instead "adopts" it
into management. When you _delete_ this resource configuration, Terraform "abandons" resource as is and just removes it from the state.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { SecurityhubAccount } from "./.gen/providers/aws/securityhub-account";
import { SecurityhubStandardsControl } from "./.gen/providers/aws/securityhub-standards-control";
import { SecurityhubStandardsSubscription } from "./.gen/providers/aws/securityhub-standards-subscription";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new SecurityhubAccount(this, "example", {});
    const cisAwsFoundationsBenchmark = new SecurityhubStandardsSubscription(
      this,
      "cis_aws_foundations_benchmark",
      {
        dependsOn: [example],
        standardsArn:
          "arn:aws:securityhub:::ruleset/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark/v/1.2.0",
      }
    );
    new SecurityhubStandardsControl(
      this,
      "ensure_iam_password_policy_prevents_password_reuse",
      {
        controlStatus: "DISABLED",
        dependsOn: [cisAwsFoundationsBenchmark],
        disabledReason: "We handle password policies within Okta",
        standardsControlArn:
          "arn:aws:securityhub:us-east-1:111111111111:control/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark/v/1.2.0/1.10",
      }
    );
  }
}

```
