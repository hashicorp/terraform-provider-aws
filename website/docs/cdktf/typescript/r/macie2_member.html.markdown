import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Macie2Account } from "./.gen/providers/aws/macie2-account";
import { Macie2Member } from "./.gen/providers/aws/macie2-member";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new Macie2Account(this, "example", {});
    const awsMacie2MemberExample = new Macie2Member(this, "example_1", {
      accountId: "AWS ACCOUNT ID",
      dependsOn: [example],
      email: "EMAIL",
      invitationDisableEmailNotification: true,
      invitationMessage: "Message of the invitation",
      invite: true,
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsMacie2MemberExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

* `accountId` - (Required) The AWS account ID for the account.
* `email` - (Required) The email address for the account.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of key-value pairs that specifies the tags to associate with the account in Amazon Macie.

* `updatedAt` - The date and time, in UTC and extended RFC 3339 format, of the most recent change to the status of the relationship between the account and the administrator account.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_macie2_member` using the account ID of the member account. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Macie2Member } from "./.gen/providers/aws/macie2-member";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    Macie2Member.generateConfigForImport(this, "example", "123456789012");
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_macie2_member` using the account ID of the member account. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_macie2_member.example 123456789012
```
