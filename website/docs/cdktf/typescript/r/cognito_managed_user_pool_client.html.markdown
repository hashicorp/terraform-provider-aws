# Resource: aws_cognito_managed_user_pool_client

Use the `awsCognitoUserPoolClient` resource to manage a Cognito User Pool Client.

**This resource is advanced** and has special caveats to consider before use. Please read this document completely before using the resource.

Use the `awsCognitoManagedUserPoolClient` resource to manage a Cognito User Pool Client that is automatically created by an AWS service. For instance, when [configuring an OpenSearch Domain to use Cognito authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/cognito-auth.html), the OpenSearch service creates the User Pool Client during setup and removes it when it is no longer required. As a result, the `awsCognitoManagedUserPoolClient` resource does not create or delete this resource, but instead assumes management of it.

Use the [`awsCognitoUserPoolClient`](cognito_user_pool_client.html) resource to manage Cognito User Pool Clients for normal use cases.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `userPoolId` - (Required) User pool that the client belongs to.
* `namePattern` - (Required, one of `name_pattern` or `name_prefix`) Regular expression that matches the name of the desired User Pool Client. It must only match one User Pool Client.
* `namePrefix` - (Required, one of `name_prefix` or `name_pattern`) String that matches the beginning of the name of the desired User Pool Client. It must match only one User Pool Client.

The following arguments are optional:

* `accessTokenValidity` - (Optional) Time limit, between 5 minutes and 1 day, after which the access token is no longer valid and cannot be used. By default, the unit is hours. The unit can be overridden by a value in `token_validity_units.access_token`.
* `allowedOauthFlowsUserPoolClient` - (Optional) Whether the client is allowed to use the OAuth protocol when interacting with Cognito user pools.

* `id` - Unique identifier for the user pool client.
* `name` - Name of the user pool client.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Cognito User Pool Clients using the `id` of the Cognito User Pool and the `id` of the Cognito User Pool Client. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Cognito User Pool Clients using the `id` of the Cognito User Pool and the `id` of the Cognito User Pool Client. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_cognito_managed_user_pool_client.client us-west-2_abc123/3ho4ek12345678909nh3fmhpko
```
