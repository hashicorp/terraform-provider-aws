# Resource: aws_budgets_budget

Provides a budgets budget resource. Budgets use the cost visualisation provided by Cost Explorer to show you the status of your budgets, to provide forecasts of your estimated costs, and to track your AWS usage, including your free tier usage.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { BudgetsBudget } from "./.gen/providers/aws/budgets-budget";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - id of resource.
* `arn` - The ARN of the budget.

### Auto Adjust Data

The parameters that determine the budget amount for an auto-adjusting budget.

`autoAdjustType` (Required) - The string that defines whether your budget auto-adjusts based on historical or forecasted data. Valid values: `forecast`,`historical`
`historicalOptions` (Optional) - Configuration block of [Historical Options](#historical-options). Required for `autoAdjustType` of `historical` Configuration block that defines the historical data that your auto-adjusting budget is based on.
`lastAutoAdjustTime` (Optional) - The last time that your budget was auto-adjusted.

### Historical Options

`budgetAdjustmentPeriod` (Required) - The number of budget periods included in the moving-average calculation that determines your auto-adjusted budget amount.
`lookbackAvailablePeriods` (Optional) - The integer that describes how many budget periods in your BudgetAdjustmentPeriod are included in the calculation of your current budget limit. If the first budget period in your BudgetAdjustmentPeriod has no cost data, then that budget period isn’t included in the average that determines your budget limit. You can’t set your own LookBackAvailablePeriods. The value is automatically calculated from the `budgetAdjustmentPeriod` and your historical cost data.

### Cost Types

Valid keys for `costTypes` parameter.

* `includeCredit` - A boolean value whether to include credits in the cost budget. Defaults to `true`

* `includeTax` - A boolean value whether to include tax in the cost budget. Defaults to `true`
* `includeUpfront` - A boolean value whether to include upfront costs in the cost budget. Defaults to `true`
* `useAmortized` - Whether a budget uses the amortized rate. Defaults to `false`
* `useBlended` - A boolean value whether to use blended costs in the cost budget. Defaults to `false`

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import budgets using `accountId:actionId:budgetName`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import budgets using `accountId:actionId:budgetName`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_budgets_budget.myBudget 123456789012:myBudget
```
