import { DxGateway } from "./.gen/providers/aws/dx-gateway";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DxGateway(this, "example", {

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Direct Connect Gateways using the gateway `id`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DxGateway } from "./.gen/providers/aws/dx-gateway";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    DxGateway.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "test",
      "abcd1234-dcba-5678-be23-cdef9876ab45"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Direct Connect Gateways using the gateway `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_dx_gateway.test abcd1234-dcba-5678-be23-cdef9876ab45
```
