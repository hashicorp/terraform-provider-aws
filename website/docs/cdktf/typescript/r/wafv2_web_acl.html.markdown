# Resource: aws_wafv2_web_acl

Creates a WAFv2 Web ACL resource.

~> **Note** In `fieldToMatch` blocks, _e.g._, in `byteMatchStatement`, the `body` block includes an optional argument `oversizeHandling`. AWS indicates this argument will be required starting February 2023. To avoid configurations breaking when that change happens, treat the `oversizeHandling` argument as **required** as soon as possible.

## Example Usage

This resource is based on `aws_wafv2_rule_group`, check the documentation of the `aws_wafv2_rule_group` resource to see examples of the various available statements.

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `associationConfig` - (Optional) Specifies custom configurations for the associations between the web ACL and protected resources. See [`associationConfig`](#association_config-block) below for details.
* `captchaConfig` - (Optional) Specifies how AWS WAF should handle CAPTCHA evaluations on the ACL level (used by [AWS Bot Control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-managed-rule-groups-bot.html)). See [`captchaConfig`](#captcha_config-block) below for details.
* `challengeConfig` - (Optional) Specifies how AWS WAF should handle Challenge evaluations on the ACL level (used by [AWS Bot Control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-managed-rule-groups-bot.html)). See [`challengeConfig`](#challenge_config-block) below for details.
* `customResponseBody` - (Optional) Defines custom response bodies that can be referenced by `customResponse` actions. See [`customResponseBody`](#custom_response_body-block) below for details.
* `defaultAction` - (Required) Action to perform if none of the `rules` contained in the WebACL match. See [`defaultAction`](#default_action-block) below for details.
* `description` - (Optional) Friendly description of the WebACL.
* `name` - (Required, Forces new resource) Friendly name of the WebACL.
* `rule` - (Optional) Rule blocks used to identify the web requests that you want to `allow`, `block`, or `count`. See [`rule`](#rule-block) below for details.
* `ruleJson` (Optional) Raw JSON string to allow more than three nested statements. Conflicts with `rule` attribute. This is for advanced use cases where more than 3 levels of nested statements are required. **There is no drift detection at this time**. If you use this attribute instead of `rule`, you will be foregoing drift detection. See the AWS [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/APIReference/API_CreateWebACL.html) for the JSON structure.
* `scope` - (Required, Forces new resource) Specifies whether this is for an AWS CloudFront distribution or for a regional application. Valid values are `CLOUDFRONT` or `REGIONAL`. To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the region `us-east-1` (N. Virginia) on the AWS provider.
* `tags` - (Optional) Map of key-value pairs to associate with the resource. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `tokenDomains` - (Optional) Specifies the domains that AWS WAF should accept in a web request token. This enables the use of tokens across multiple protected websites.

To inspect more than one component of a web request, create a separate rule statement for each component. See the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component) for more details.

The `fieldToMatch` block supports the following arguments:

~> **Note** Only one of `allQueryArguments`, `body`, `cookies`, `headerOrder`, `headers`, `ja3Fingerprint`, `jsonBody`, `method`, `queryString`, `singleHeader`, `singleQueryArgument`, or `uriPath` can be specified. An empty configuration block `{}` should be used when specifying `allQueryArguments`, `method`, or `queryString` attributes.

### `forwardedIpConfig` Block

The configuration for inspecting IP addresses in an HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the IP address that's reported by the web request origin. Commonly, this is the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name. If the specified header isn't present in the request, AWS WAFv2 doesn't apply the rule to the web request at all. AWS WAFv2 only evaluates the first IP address found in the specified HTTP header.

The `forwardedIpConfig` block supports the following arguments:

* `fallbackBehavior` - (Required) - Match status to assign to the web request if the request doesn't have a valid IP address in the specified position. Valid values include: `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH`.
* `headerName` - (Required) - Name of the HTTP header to use for the IP address.

### `ipSetForwardedIpConfig` Block

The configuration for inspecting IP addresses in an HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the IP address that's reported by the web request origin. Commonly, this is the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

The `ipSetForwardedIpConfig` block supports the following arguments:

* `fallbackBehavior` - (Required) - Match status to assign to the web request if the request doesn't have a valid IP address in the specified position. Valid values include: `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH`.

* `position` - (Required) - Position in the header to search for the IP address. Valid values include: `FIRST`, `LAST`, or `ANY`. If `ANY` is specified and the header contains more than 10 IP addresses, AWS WAFv2 inspects the last 10.

### `headerOrder` Block

Inspect a string containing the list of the request's header names, ordered as they appear in the web request that AWS WAF receives for inspection. AWS WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to match component in its inspection. AWS WAF separates the header names in the string using colons and no added spaces, for example `host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer`.

The `headerOrder` block supports the following arguments:

* `oversizeHandling` - (Required) Oversize handling tells AWS WAF what to do with a web request when the request component that the rule inspects is over the limits. Valid values include the following: `CONTINUE`, `MATCH`, `NO_MATCH`. See the AWS [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-oversize-handling.html) for more information.
