# Resource: aws_chimesdkvoice_sip_media_application

A ChimeSDKVoice SIP Media Application is a managed object that passes values from a SIP rule to a target AWS Lambda function.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ChimesdkvoiceSipMediaApplication } from "./.gen/providers/aws/chimesdkvoice-sip-media-application";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new ChimesdkvoiceSipMediaApplication(this, "example", {
      awsRegion: "us-east-1",
      endpoints: {
        lambdaArn: test.arn,
      },
      name: "example-sip-media-application",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `awsRegion` - (Required) The AWS Region in which the AWS Chime SDK Voice Sip Media Application is created.
* `endpoints` - (Required)  List of endpoints (Lambda Amazon Resource Names) specified for the SIP media application. Currently, only one endpoint is supported. See [`endpoints`](#endpoints).
* `name` - (Required) The name of the AWS Chime SDK Voice Sip Media Application.

The following arguments are optional:

* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value mapping of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

### `endpoints`

The endpoint assigned to the SIP media application.

* `lambdaArn` - (Required) Valid Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda function, version, or alias. The function must be created in the same AWS Region as the SIP media application.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` -  ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the AWS Chime SDK Voice Sip Media Application
* `id` - The SIP media application ID.
* `tagsAll` - Map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import a ChimeSDKVoice SIP Media Application using the `id`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ChimesdkvoiceSipMediaApplication } from "./.gen/providers/aws/chimesdkvoice-sip-media-application";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    ChimesdkvoiceSipMediaApplication.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "abcdef123456"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import a ChimeSDKVoice SIP Media Application using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_chimesdkvoice_sip_media_application.example abcdef123456
```
