### health_check

~> **Note:** The Health Check parameters you can set vary by the `protocol` of the Target Group. Many parameters cannot be set to custom values for `network` load balancers at this time. See http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTargetGroup.html for a complete reference. Keep in mind, that health checks produce actual requests to the backend. The underlying function is invoked when `targetType` is set to `lambda`.

* `enabled` - (Optional) Whether health checks are enabled. Defaults to `true`.
* `healthyThreshold` - (Optional)  Number of consecutive health check successes required before considering a target healthy. The range is 2-10. Defaults to 3.
* `interval` - (Optional) Approximate amount of time, in seconds, between health checks of an individual target. The range is 5-300. For `lambda` target groups, it needs to be greater than the timeout of the underlying `lambda`. Defaults to 30.
* `matcher` (Optional) The HTTP or gRPC codes to use when checking for a successful response from a target.
  The `health_check.protocol` must be one of `HTTP` or `HTTPS` or the `targetType` must be `lambda`.
  Values can be comma-separated individual values (e.g., "200,202") or a range of values (e.g., "200-299").
    * For gRPC-based target groups (i.e., the `protocol` is one of `HTTP` or `HTTPS` and the `protocolVersion` is `GRPC`), values can be between `0` and `99`. The default is `12`.
    * When used with an Application Load Balancer (i.e., the `protocol` is one of `HTTP` or `HTTPS` and the `protocolVersion` is not `GRPC`), values can be between `200` and `499`. The default is `200`.
    * When used with a Network Load Balancer (i.e., the `protocol` is one of `TCP`, `TCP_UDP`, `UDP`, or `TLS`), values can be between `200` and `599`. The default is `200-399`.
    * When the `targetType` is `lambda`, values can be between `200` and `499`. The default is `200`.
* `path` - (May be required) Destination for the health check request. Required for HTTP/HTTPS ALB and HTTP NLB. Only applies to HTTP/HTTPS.
    * For HTTP and HTTPS health checks, the default is `/`.
    * For gRPC health checks, the default is `/Amazon Web Services.ALB/healthcheck`.
* `port` - (Optional) The port the load balancer uses when performing health checks on targets.
  Valid values are either `traffic-port`, to use the same port as the target group, or a valid port number between `1` and `65536`.
  Default is `traffic-port`.
* `protocol` - (Optional) Protocol the load balancer uses when performing health checks on targets.
  Must be one of `TCP`, `HTTP`, or `HTTPS`.
  The `TCP` protocol is not supported for health checks if the protocol of the target group is `HTTP` or `HTTPS`.
  Default is `HTTP`.
  Cannot be specified when the `targetType` is `lambda`.
* `timeout` - (optional) Amount of time, in seconds, during which no response from a target means a failed health check. The range is 2–120 seconds. For target groups with a protocol of HTTP, the default is 6 seconds. For target groups with a protocol of TCP, TLS or HTTPS, the default is 10 seconds. For target groups with a protocol of GENEVE, the default is 5 seconds. If the target type is lambda, the default is 30 seconds.
* `unhealthyThreshold` - (Optional) Number of consecutive health check failures required before considering a target unhealthy. The range is 2-10. Defaults to 3.

### stickiness

~> **NOTE:** Currently, an NLB (i.e., protocol of `HTTP` or `HTTPS`) can have an invalid `stickiness` block with `type` set to `lb_cookie` as long as `enabled` is set to `false`. However, please update your configurations to avoid errors in a future version of the provider: either remove the invalid `stickiness` block or set the `type` to `sourceIp`.

* `cookieDuration` - (Optional) Only used when the type is `lb_cookie`. The time period, in seconds, during which requests from a client should be routed to the same target. After this time period expires, the load balancer-generated cookie is considered stale. The range is 1 second to 1 week (604800 seconds). The default value is 1 day (86400 seconds).
* `cookieName` - (Optional) Name of the application based cookie. AWSALB, AWSALBAPP, and AWSALBTG prefixes are reserved and cannot be used. Only needed when type is `app_cookie`.
* `enabled` - (Optional) Boolean to enable / disable `stickiness`. Default is `true`.
* `type` - (Required) The type of sticky sessions. The only current possible values are `lb_cookie`, `app_cookie` for ALBs, `sourceIp` for NLBs, and `source_ip_dest_ip`, `source_ip_dest_ip_proto` for GWLBs.

### target_failover

~> **NOTE:** This block is only applicable for a Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB). The two attributes `onDeregistration` and `onUnhealthy` cannot be set independently. The value you set for both attributes must be the same.

* `onDeregistration` - (Optional) Indicates how the GWLB handles existing flows when a target is deregistered. Possible values are `rebalance` and `no_rebalance`. Must match the attribute value set for `onUnhealthy`. Default: `no_rebalance`.
* `onUnhealthy` - Indicates how the GWLB handles existing flows when a target is unhealthy. Possible values are `rebalance` and `no_rebalance`. Must match the attribute value set for `onDeregistration`. Default: `no_rebalance`.

### target_health_state

~> **NOTE:** This block is only valid for a Network Load Balancer (NLB) target group when `protocol` is `TCP` or `TLS`.

* `enableUnhealthyConnectionTermination` - (Optional) Indicates whether the load balancer terminates connections to unhealthy targets. Possible values are `true` or `false`. Default: `true`.
* `unhealthy_draining_interval` - (Optional) Indicates the time to wait for in-flight requests to complete when a target becomes unhealthy. The range is `0-360000`. This value has to be set only if `enableUnhealthyConnectionTermination` is set to false. Default: `0`.

### target_group_health

~> **NOTE:** This block is only supported by Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers.

The `targetGroupHealth` block supports the following:

* `dnsFailover` - (Optional) Block to configure DNS Failover requirements. See [DNS Failover](#dns_failover) below for details on attributes.
* `unhealthyStateRouting` - (Optional) Block to configure Unhealthy State Routing requirements. See [Unhealthy State Routing](#unhealthy_state_routing) below for details on attributes.

### dns_failover

The `dnsFailover` block supports the following:

* `minimumHealthyTargetsCount` - (Optional) The minimum number of targets that must be healthy. If the number of healthy targets is below this value, mark the zone as unhealthy in DNS, so that traffic is routed only to healthy zones. The possible values are `off` or an integer from `1` to the maximum number of targets. The default is `off`.
* `minimumHealthyTargetsPercentage` - (Optional) The minimum percentage of targets that must be healthy. If the percentage of healthy targets is below this value, mark the zone as unhealthy in DNS, so that traffic is routed only to healthy zones. The possible values are `off` or an integer from `1` to `100`. The default is `off`.

### unhealthy_state_routing

The `unhealthyStateRouting` block supports the following:

* `minimumHealthyTargetsCount` - (Optional) The minimum number of targets that must be healthy. If the number of healthy targets is below this value, send traffic to all targets, including unhealthy targets. The possible values are `1` to the maximum number of targets. The default is `1`.
* `minimumHealthyTargetsPercentage` - (Optional) The minimum percentage of targets that must be healthy. If the percentage of healthy targets is below this value, send traffic to all targets, including unhealthy targets. The possible values are `off` or an integer from `1` to `100`. The default is `off`.
