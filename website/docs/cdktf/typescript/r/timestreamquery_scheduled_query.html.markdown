# Resource: aws_timestreamquery_scheduled_query

Terraform resource for managing an AWS Timestream Query Scheduled Query.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

Before creating a scheduled query, you must have a source database and table with ingested data. Below is a [multi-step example](#multi-step-example), providing an opportunity for data ingestion.

If your infrastructure is already set up—including the source database and table with data, results database and table, error report S3 bucket, SNS topic, and IAM role—you can create a scheduled query as follows:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { TimestreamqueryScheduledQuery } from "./.gen/providers/aws/timestreamquery-scheduled-query";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new TimestreamqueryScheduledQuery(this, "example", {
      errorReportConfiguration: [
        {
          s3Configuration: [
            {
              bucketName: Token.asString(awsS3BucketExample.bucket),
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
      executionRoleArn: Token.asString(awsIamRoleExample.arn),
      name: Token.asString(awsTimestreamwriteTableExample.tableName),
      notificationConfiguration: [
        {
          snsConfiguration: [
            {
              topicArn: Token.asString(awsSnsTopicExample.arn),
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
      queryString:
        "SELECT region, az, hostname, BIN(time, 15s) AS binned_timestamp,\n\tROUND(AVG(cpu_utilization), 2) AS avg_cpu_utilization,\n\tROUND(APPROX_PERCENTILE(cpu_utilization, 0.9), 2) AS p90_cpu_utilization,\n\tROUND(APPROX_PERCENTILE(cpu_utilization, 0.95), 2) AS p95_cpu_utilization,\n\tROUND(APPROX_PERCENTILE(cpu_utilization, 0.99), 2) AS p99_cpu_utilization\nFROM exampledatabase.exampletable\nWHERE measure_name = 'metrics' AND time > ago(2h)\nGROUP BY region, hostname, az, BIN(time, 15s)\nORDER BY binned_timestamp ASC\nLIMIT 5\n\n",
      scheduleConfiguration: [
        {
          scheduleExpression: "rate(1 hour)",
        },
      ],
      targetConfiguration: [
        {
          timestreamConfiguration: [
            {
              databaseName: results.databaseName,
              dimensionMapping: [
                {
                  dimensionValueType: "VARCHAR",
                  name: "az",
                },
                {
                  dimensionValueType: "VARCHAR",
                  name: "region",
                },
                {
                  dimensionValueType: "VARCHAR",
                  name: "hostname",
                },
              ],
              multiMeasureMappings: [
                {
                  multiMeasureAttributeMapping: [
                    {
                      measureValueType: "DOUBLE",
                      sourceColumn: "avg_cpu_utilization",
                    },
                    {
                      measureValueType: "DOUBLE",
                      sourceColumn: "p90_cpu_utilization",
                    },
                    {
                      measureValueType: "DOUBLE",
                      sourceColumn: "p95_cpu_utilization",
                    },
                    {
                      measureValueType: "DOUBLE",
                      sourceColumn: "p99_cpu_utilization",
                    },
                  ],
                  targetMultiMeasureName: "multi-metrics",
                },
              ],
              tableName: Token.asString(
                awsTimestreamwriteTableResults.tableName
              ),
              timeColumn: "binned_timestamp",
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
    });
  }
}

```

### Multi-step Example

To ingest data before creating a scheduled query, this example provides multiple steps:

1. [Create the prerequisite infrastructure](#step-1-create-the-prerequisite-infrastructure)
2. [Ingest data](#step-2-ingest-data)
3. [Create the scheduled query](#step-3-create-the-scheduled-query)

#### Step 1. Create the prerequisite infrastructure

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `errorReportConfiguration` - (Required) Configuration block for error reporting configuration. [See below.](#error_report_configuration)
* `executionRoleArn` - (Required) ARN for the IAM role that Timestream will assume when running the scheduled query.
* `name` - (Required) Name of the scheduled query.
* `notificationConfiguration` - (Required) Configuration block for notification configuration for a scheduled query. A notification is sent by Timestream when a scheduled query is created, its state is updated, or when it is deleted. [See below.](#notification_configuration)
* `queryString` - (Required) Query string to run. Parameter names can be specified in the query string using the `@` character followed by an identifier. The named parameter `@scheduled_runtime` is reserved and can be used in the query to get the time at which the query is scheduled to run. The timestamp calculated according to the `scheduleConfiguration` parameter, will be the value of `@scheduled_runtime` paramater for each query run. For example, consider an instance of a scheduled query executing on 2021-12-01 00:00:00. For this instance, the `@scheduled_runtime` parameter is initialized to the timestamp 2021-12-01 00:00:00 when invoking the query.
* `scheduleConfiguration` - (Required) Configuration block for schedule configuration for the query. [See below.](#schedule_configuration)
* `targetConfiguration` - (Required) Configuration block for writing the result of a query. [See below.](#target_configuration)

The following arguments are optional:

* `region` - (Optional) Region where this resource will be [managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints). Defaults to the Region set in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#aws-configuration-reference).
* `kmsKeyId` - (Optional) Amazon KMS key used to encrypt the scheduled query resource, at-rest. If not specified, the scheduled query resource will be encrypted with a Timestream owned Amazon KMS key. To specify a KMS key, use the key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias name, prefix the name with "alias/". If `errorReportConfiguration` uses `SSE_KMS` as the encryption type, the same `kmsKeyId` is used to encrypt the error report at rest.
* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags assigned to the resource. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

### `errorReportConfiguration`

* `s3Configuration` - (Required) Configuration block for the S3 configuration for the error reports. [See below.](#s3_configuration)

#### `s3Configuration`

* `bucketName` - (Required) Name of the S3 bucket under which error reports will be created.
* `encryptionOption` - (Optional) Encryption at rest options for the error reports. If no encryption option is specified, Timestream will choose `SSE_S3` as default. Valid values are `SSE_S3`, `SSE_KMS`.
* `objectKeyPrefix` - (Optional) Prefix for the error report key.

### `notificationConfiguration`

* `snsConfiguration` - (Required) Configuration block for details about the Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) configuration. [See below.](#sns_configuration)

#### `snsConfiguration`

* `topicArn` - (Required) SNS topic ARN that the scheduled query status notifications will be sent to.

### `scheduleConfiguration`

* `scheduleExpression` - (Required) When to trigger the scheduled query run. This can be a cron expression or a rate expression.

### `targetConfiguration`

* `timestreamConfiguration` - (Required) Configuration block for information needed to write data into the Timestream database and table. [See below.](#timestream_configuration)

#### `timestreamConfiguration`

* `databaseName` - (Required) Name of Timestream database to which the query result will be written.
* `dimensionMapping` - (Required) Configuration block for mapping of column(s) from the query result to the dimension in the destination table. [See below.](#dimension_mapping)
* `tableName` - (Required) Name of Timestream table that the query result will be written to. The table should be within the same database that is provided in Timestream configuration.
* `timeColumn` - (Required) Column from query result that should be used as the time column in destination table. Column type for this should be TIMESTAMP.
* `measureNameColumn` - (Optional) Name of the measure column.
* `mixedMeasureMapping` - (Optional) Configuration block for how to map measures to multi-measure records. [See below.](#mixed_measure_mapping)
* `multiMeasureMappings` - (Optional) Configuration block for multi-measure mappings. Only one of `mixed_measure_mappings` or `multiMeasureMappings` can be provided. `multiMeasureMappings` can be used to ingest data as multi measures in the derived table. [See below.](#multi_measure_mappings)

##### `dimensionMapping`

* `dimensionValueType` - (Required) Type for the dimension. Valid value: `VARCHAR`.
* `name` - (Required) Column name from query result.

import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { TimestreamqueryScheduledQuery } from "./.gen/providers/aws/timestreamquery-scheduled-query";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    TimestreamqueryScheduledQuery.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "arn:aws:timestream:us-west-2:012345678901:scheduled-query/tf-acc-test-7774188528604787105-e13659544fe66c8d"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Timestream Query Scheduled Query using the `arn`. For example:
