# Resource: aws_codedeploy_deployment_group

Provides a CodeDeploy Deployment Group for a CodeDeploy Application

~> **NOTE on blue/green deployments:** When using `greenFleetProvisioningOption` with the `COPY_AUTO_SCALING_GROUP` action, CodeDeploy will create a new ASG with a different name. This ASG is _not_ managed by terraform and will conflict with existing configuration and state. You may want to use a different approach to managing deployments that involve multiple ASG, such as `DISCOVER_EXISTING` with separate blue and green ASG.

_Only one `alarmConfiguration` is allowed_.

### auto_rollback_configuration Argument Reference

* `action` - (Optional) The method used to add instances to a replacement environment.
    * `DISCOVER_EXISTING`: Use instances that already exist or will be created manually.
    * `COPY_AUTO_SCALING_GROUP`: Use settings from a specified **Auto Scaling** group to define and create instances in a new Auto Scaling group. _Exactly one Auto Scaling group must be specified_ when selecting `COPY_AUTO_SCALING_GROUP`. Use `autoscalingGroups` to specify the Auto Scaling group.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import CodeDeploy Deployment Groups using `appName`, a colon, and `deploymentGroupName`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { CodedeployDeploymentGroup } from "./.gen/providers/aws/codedeploy-deployment-group";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    CodedeployDeploymentGroup.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "my-application:my-deployment-group"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import CodeDeploy Deployment Groups using `appName`, a colon, and `deploymentGroupName`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_codedeploy_deployment_group.example my-application:my-deployment-group
```
