# Resource: aws_cloudwatch_event_permission

Provides a resource to create an EventBridge permission to support cross-account events in the current account default event bus.

~> **Note:** EventBridge was formerly known as CloudWatch Events. The functionality is identical.

~> **Note:** The EventBridge bus policy resource  (`awsCloudwatchEventBusPolicy`) is incompatible with the EventBridge permission resource (`awsCloudwatchEventPermission`) and will overwrite permissions.

## Example Usage

### Account Access

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { CloudwatchEventPermission } from "./.gen/providers/aws/cloudwatch-event-permission";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new CloudwatchEventPermission(this, "DevAccountAccess", {
      principal: "123456789012",
      statementId: "DevAccountAccess",
    });
  }
}

```

### Organization Access

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { CloudwatchEventPermission } from "./.gen/providers/aws/cloudwatch-event-permission";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new CloudwatchEventPermission(this, "OrganizationAccess", {
      condition: {
        key: "aws:PrincipalOrgID",
        type: "StringEquals",
        value: example.id,
      },
      principal: "*",
      statementId: "OrganizationAccess",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `principal` - (Required) The 12-digit AWS account ID that you are permitting to put events to your default event bus. Specify `*` to permit any account to put events to your default event bus, optionally limited by `condition`.
* `statementId` - (Required) An identifier string for the external account that you are granting permissions to.
* `action` - (Optional) The action that you are enabling the other account to perform. Defaults to `events:PutEvents`.
* `condition` - (Optional) Configuration block to limit the event bus permissions you are granting to only accounts that fulfill the condition. Specified below.
* `eventBusName` - (Optional) The name of the event bus to set the permissions on.
  If you omit this, the permissions are set on the `default` event bus.

### condition

* `key` - (Required) Key for the condition. Valid values: `aws:PrincipalOrgID`.
* `type` - (Required) Type of condition. Value values: `StringEquals`.
* `value` - (Required) Value for the key.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The statement ID of the EventBridge permission.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import EventBridge permissions using the `eventBusName/statementId` (if you omit `eventBusName`, the `default` event bus will be used). For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import EventBridge permissions using the `eventBusName/statementId` (if you omit `eventBusName`, the `default` event bus will be used). For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_cloudwatch_event_permission.DevAccountAccess example-event-bus/DevAccountAccess
```
