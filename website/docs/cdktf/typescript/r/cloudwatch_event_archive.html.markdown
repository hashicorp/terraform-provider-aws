# Resource: aws_cloudwatch_event_archive

Provides an EventBridge event archive resource.

~> **Note:** EventBridge was formerly known as CloudWatch Events. The functionality is identical.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { CloudwatchEventArchive } from "./.gen/providers/aws/cloudwatch-event-archive";
import { CloudwatchEventBus } from "./.gen/providers/aws/cloudwatch-event-bus";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const order = new CloudwatchEventBus(this, "order", {
      name: "orders",
    });
    const awsCloudwatchEventArchiveOrder = new CloudwatchEventArchive(
      this,
      "order_1",
      {
        eventSourceArn: order.arn,
        name: "order-archive",
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsCloudwatchEventArchiveOrder.overrideLogicalId("order");
  }
}

```

## Example all optional arguments

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Fn, Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { CloudwatchEventArchive } from "./.gen/providers/aws/cloudwatch-event-archive";
import { CloudwatchEventBus } from "./.gen/providers/aws/cloudwatch-event-bus";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const order = new CloudwatchEventBus(this, "order", {
      name: "orders",
    });
    const awsCloudwatchEventArchiveOrder = new CloudwatchEventArchive(
      this,
      "order_1",
      {
        description: "Archived events from order service",
        eventPattern: Token.asString(
          Fn.jsonencode({
            source: ["company.team.order"],
          })
        ),
        eventSourceArn: order.arn,
        name: "order-archive",
        retentionDays: 7,
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsCloudwatchEventArchiveOrder.overrideLogicalId("order");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the new event archive. The archive name cannot exceed 48 characters.
* `eventSourceArn` - (Required) Event bus source ARN from where these events should be archived.
* `description` - (Optional) The description of the new event archive.
* `eventPattern` - (Optional) Instructs the new event archive to only capture events matched by this pattern. By default, it attempts to archive every event received in the `eventSourceArn`.
* `retentionDays` - (Optional) The maximum number of days to retain events in the new event archive. By default, it archives indefinitely.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the event archive.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import an EventBridge archive using the `name`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { CloudwatchEventArchive } from "./.gen/providers/aws/cloudwatch-event-archive";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    CloudwatchEventArchive.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "importedEventArchive",
      "order-archive"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import an EventBridge archive using the `name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_cloudwatch_event_archive.imported_event_archive order-archive
```
