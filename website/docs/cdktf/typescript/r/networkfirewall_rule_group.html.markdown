### Stateful Inspection for permitting packets from a source IP address

```typescript

import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformIterator, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";

    /*In most cases loops should be handled in the programming language context and 
    not inside of the Terraform context. If you are looping over something external, e.g. a variable or a file input
    you should consider using a for loop. If you are looping over something only known to Terraform, e.g. a result of a data source
    you need to keep this like it is.*/

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `capacity` - (Required, Forces new resource) The maximum number of operating resources that this rule group can use. For a stateless rule group, the capacity required is the sum of the capacity requirements of the individual rules. For a stateful rule group, the minimum capacity required is the number of individual rules.

* `description` - (Optional) A friendly description of the rule group.

* `encryptionConfiguration` - (Optional) KMS encryption configuration settings. See [Encryption Configuration](#encryption-configuration) below for details.

* `name` - (Required, Forces new resource) A friendly name of the rule group.

* `rules` - (Optional) The stateful rule group rules specifications in Suricata file format, with one rule per line. Use this to import your existing Suricata compatible rule groups. Required unless `ruleGroup` is specified.

* `tags` - (Optional) A map of key:value pairs to associate with the resource. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

* `type` - (Required) Whether the rule group is stateless (containing stateless rules) or stateful (containing stateful rules). Valid values include: `STATEFUL` or `STATELESS`.

### Encryption Configuration

`encryptionConfiguration` settings for customer managed KMS keys. Remove this block to use the default AWS-managed KMS encryption (rather than setting `type` to `AWS_OWNED_KMS_KEY`).

* `keyId` - (Optional) The ID of the customer managed key. You can use any of the [key identifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-id) that KMS supports, unless you're using a key that's managed by another account. If you're using a key managed by another account, then specify the key ARN.

* `priority` - (Required) A setting that indicates the order in which to run this rule relative to all of the rules that are defined for a stateless rule group. AWS Network Firewall evaluates the rules in a rule group starting with the lowest priority setting.

* `ruleDefinition` - (Required) A configuration block defining the stateless 5-tuple packet inspection criteria and the action to take on a packet that matches the criteria. See [Rule Definition](#rule-definition) below for details.

### Rule Definition

The `ruleDefinition` block supports the following arguments:

* `actions` - (Required) Set of actions to take on a packet that matches one of the stateless rule definition's `matchAttributes`. For every rule you must specify 1 standard action, and you can add custom actions. Standard actions include: `aws:pass`, `aws:drop`, `aws:forward_to_sfe`.

* `matchAttributes` - (Required) A configuration block containing criteria for AWS Network Firewall to use to inspect an individual packet in stateless rule inspection. See [Match Attributes](#match-attributes) below for details.

### Match Attributes

The `matchAttributes` block supports the following arguments:

* `destination` - (Optional) Set of configuration blocks describing the destination IP address and address ranges to inspect for, in CIDR notation. If not specified, this matches with any destination address. See [Destination](#destination) below for details.

* `destinationPort` - (Optional) Set of configuration blocks describing the destination ports to inspect for. If not specified, this matches with any destination port. See [Destination Port](#destination-port) below for details.

* `protocols` - (Optional) Set of protocols to inspect for, specified using the protocol's assigned internet protocol number (IANA). If not specified, this matches with any protocol.

* `source` - (Optional) Set of configuration blocks describing the source IP address and address ranges to inspect for, in CIDR notation. If not specified, this matches with any source address. See [Source](#source) below for details.

* `sourcePort` - (Optional) Set of configuration blocks describing the source ports to inspect for. If not specified, this matches with any source port. See [Source Port](#source-port) below for details.

* `tcpFlag` - (Optional) Set of configuration blocks containing the TCP flags and masks to inspect for. If not specified, this matches with any settings.

### Action Definition

The `actionDefinition` block supports the following argument:

* `publishMetricAction` - (Required) A configuration block describing the stateless inspection criteria that publishes the specified metrics to Amazon CloudWatch for the matching packet. You can pair this custom action with any of the standard stateless rule actions. See [Publish Metric Action](#publish-metric-action) below for details.

### Publish Metric Action

The `publishMetricAction` block supports the following argument:

* `dimension` - (Required) Set of configuration blocks containing the dimension settings to use for Amazon CloudWatch custom metrics. See [Dimension](#dimension) below for details.

### Dimension

The `dimension` block supports the following argument:

* `value` - (Required) The value to use in the custom metric dimension.

### Destination

The `destination` block supports the following argument:

* `addressDefinition` - (Required)  An IP address or a block of IP addresses in CIDR notation. AWS Network Firewall supports all address ranges for IPv4.

### Destination Port

The `destinationPort` block supports the following arguments:

* `fromPort` - (Required) The lower limit of the port range. This must be less than or equal to the `toPort`.

* `toPort` - (Optional) The upper limit of the port range. This must be greater than or equal to the `fromPort`.

### Source

The `source` block supports the following argument:

* `addressDefinition` - (Required)  An IP address or a block of IP addresses in CIDR notation. AWS Network Firewall supports all address ranges for IPv4.

### Source Port

The `sourcePort` block supports the following arguments:

* `fromPort` - (Required) The lower limit of the port range. This must be less than or equal to the `toPort`.

* `toPort` - (Optional) The upper limit of the port range. This must be greater than or equal to the `fromPort`.

### TCP Flag

The `tcpFlag` block supports the following arguments:

* `flags` - (Required) Set of flags to look for in a packet. This setting can only specify values that are also specified in `masks`.
Valid values: `FIN`, `SYN`, `RST`, `PSH`, `ACK`, `URG`, `ECE`, `CWR`.

* `masks` - (Optional) Set of flags to consider in the inspection. To inspect all flags, leave this empty.
Valid values: `FIN`, `SYN`, `RST`, `PSH`, `ACK`, `URG`, `ECE`, `CWR`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the rule group.

* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the rule group.

* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

* `updateToken` - A string token used when updating the rule group.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Network Firewall Rule Groups using their `arn`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { NetworkfirewallRuleGroup } from "./.gen/providers/aws/networkfirewall-rule-group";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    NetworkfirewallRuleGroup.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "arn:aws:network-firewall:us-west-1:123456789012:stateful-rulegroup/example"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Network Firewall Rule Groups using their `arn`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_networkfirewall_rule_group.example arn:aws:network-firewall:us-west-1:123456789012:stateful-rulegroup/example
```
