## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import QuickSight Folder Membership using the AWS account ID, folder ID, member type, and member ID separated by commas (`,`). For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { QuicksightFolderMembership } from "./.gen/providers/aws/quicksight-folder-membership";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    QuicksightFolderMembership.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "123456789012,example-folder,DATASET,example-dataset"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import QuickSight Folder Membership using the AWS account ID, folder ID, member type, and member ID separated by commas (`,`). For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_quicksight_folder_membership.example 123456789012,example-folder,DATASET,example-dataset
```
