# Resource: aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration

Provides an S3 bucket CORS configuration resource. For more information about CORS, go to [Enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/cors.html) in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

~> **NOTE:** S3 Buckets only support a single CORS configuration. Declaring multiple `awsS3BucketCorsConfiguration` resources to the same S3 Bucket will cause a perpetual difference in configuration.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { S3Bucket } from "./.gen/providers/aws/s3-bucket";
import { S3BucketCorsConfiguration } from "./.gen/providers/aws/s3-bucket-cors-configuration";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new S3Bucket(this, "example", {
      bucket: "mybucket",
    });
    const awsS3BucketCorsConfigurationExample = new S3BucketCorsConfiguration(
      this,
      "example_1",
      {
        bucket: example.id,
        corsRule: [
          {
            allowedHeaders: ["*"],
            allowedMethods: ["PUT", "POST"],
            allowedOrigins: ["https://s3-website-test.hashicorp.com"],
            exposeHeaders: ["ETag"],
            maxAgeSeconds: 3000,
          },
          {
            allowedMethods: ["GET"],
            allowedOrigins: ["*"],
          },
        ],
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsS3BucketCorsConfigurationExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `bucket` - (Required, Forces new resource) Name of the bucket.
* `expectedBucketOwner` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Account ID of the expected bucket owner.
* `corsRule` - (Required) Set of origins and methods (cross-origin access that you want to allow). [See below](#cors_rule). You can configure up to 100 rules.

### cors_rule

The `corsRule` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `allowedHeaders` - (Optional) Set of Headers that are specified in the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` header.
* `allowedMethods` - (Required) Set of HTTP methods that you allow the origin to execute. Valid values are `GET`, `PUT`, `HEAD`, `POST`, and `DELETE`.
* `allowedOrigins` - (Required) Set of origins you want customers to be able to access the bucket from.
* `exposeHeaders` - (Optional) Set of headers in the response that you want customers to be able to access from their applications (for example, from a JavaScript `XMLHttpRequest` object).
* `id` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the rule. The value cannot be longer than 255 characters.
* `maxAgeSeconds` - (Optional) Time in seconds that your browser is to cache the preflight response for the specified resource.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The `bucket` or `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`) if the latter is provided.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import S3 bucket CORS configuration using the `bucket` or using the `bucket` and `expectedBucketOwner` separated by a comma (`,`). For example:

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket is the same account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket`:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket differs from the account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket` and `expectedBucketOwner` separated by a comma (`,`):

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

**Using `terraform import` to import** S3 bucket CORS configuration using the `bucket` or using the `bucket` and `expectedBucketOwner` separated by a comma (`,`). For example:

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket is the same account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket`:

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration.example bucket-name
```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket differs from the account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket` and `expectedBucketOwner` separated by a comma (`,`):

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration.example bucket-name,123456789012
```
