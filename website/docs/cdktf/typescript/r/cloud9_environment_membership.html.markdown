# Resource: aws_cloud9_environment_membership

Provides an environment member to an AWS Cloud9 development environment.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Cloud9EnvironmentEc2 } from "./.gen/providers/aws/cloud9-environment-ec2";
import { Cloud9EnvironmentMembership } from "./.gen/providers/aws/cloud9-environment-membership";
import { IamUser } from "./.gen/providers/aws/iam-user";
interface MyConfig {
  imageId: any;
}
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string, config: MyConfig) {
    super(scope, name);
    const test = new Cloud9EnvironmentEc2(this, "test", {
      instanceType: "t2.micro",
      name: "some-env",
      imageId: config.imageId,
    });
    const awsIamUserTest = new IamUser(this, "test_1", {
      name: "some-user",
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsIamUserTest.overrideLogicalId("test");
    const awsCloud9EnvironmentMembershipTest = new Cloud9EnvironmentMembership(
      this,
      "test_2",
      {
        environmentId: test.id,
        permissions: "read-only",
        userArn: Token.asString(awsIamUserTest.arn),
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsCloud9EnvironmentMembershipTest.overrideLogicalId("test");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `environmentId` - (Required) The ID of the environment that contains the environment member you want to add.
* `permissions` - (Required) The type of environment member permissions you want to associate with this environment member. Allowed values are `read-only` and `read-write` .
* `userArn` - (Required) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the environment member you want to add.

* `id` - The ID of the environment membership.
* `userId` - The user ID in AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) of the environment member.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Cloud9 environment membership using the `environment-id#user-arn`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Cloud9EnvironmentMembership } from "./.gen/providers/aws/cloud9-environment-membership";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    Cloud9EnvironmentMembership.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "test",
      "environment-id#user-arn"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Cloud9 environment membership using the `environment-id#user-arn`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_cloud9_environment_membership.test environment-id#user-arn
```
