# Resource: aws_network_interface_sg_attachment

This resource attaches a security group to an Elastic Network Interface (ENI).
It can be used to attach a security group to any existing ENI, be it a
secondary ENI or one attached as the primary interface on an instance.

~> **NOTE on instances, interfaces, and security groups:** Terraform currently
provides the capability to assign security groups via the [`awsInstance`][1]
and the [`awsNetworkInterface`][2] resources. Using this resource in
conjunction with security groups provided in-line in those resources will cause
conflicts, and will lead to spurious diffs and undefined behavior - please use
one or the other.

## Example Usage

The following provides a very basic example of setting up an instance (provided
by `instance`) in the default security group, creating a security group
(provided by `sg`) and then attaching the security group to the instance's
primary network interface via the `awsNetworkInterfaceSgAttachment` resource,
named `sgAttachment`:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsAmi } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-ami";
import { Instance } from "./.gen/providers/aws/instance";
import { NetworkInterfaceSgAttachment } from "./.gen/providers/aws/network-interface-sg-attachment";
import { SecurityGroup } from "./.gen/providers/aws/security-group";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const sg = new SecurityGroup(this, "sg", {
      tags: {
        type: "terraform-test-security-group",
      },
    });
    const ami = new DataAwsAmi(this, "ami", {
      filter: [
        {
          name: "name",
          values: ["amzn-ami-hvm-*"],
        },
      ],
      mostRecent: true,
      owners: ["amazon"],
    });
    const instance = new Instance(this, "instance", {
      ami: Token.asString(ami.id),
      instanceType: "t2.micro",
      tags: {
        type: "terraform-test-instance",
      },
    });
    new NetworkInterfaceSgAttachment(this, "sg_attachment", {
      networkInterfaceId: instance.primaryNetworkInterfaceId,
      securityGroupId: sg.id,
    });
  }
}

```

In this example, `instance` is provided by the `awsInstance` data source,
fetching an external instance, possibly not managed by Terraform.
`sgAttachment` then attaches to the output instance's `networkInterfaceId`:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsInstance } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-instance";
import { NetworkInterfaceSgAttachment } from "./.gen/providers/aws/network-interface-sg-attachment";
import { SecurityGroup } from "./.gen/providers/aws/security-group";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const sg = new SecurityGroup(this, "sg", {
      tags: {
        type: "terraform-test-security-group",
      },
    });
    const instance = new DataAwsInstance(this, "instance", {
      instanceId: "i-1234567890abcdef0",
    });
    new NetworkInterfaceSgAttachment(this, "sg_attachment", {
      networkInterfaceId: Token.asString(instance.networkInterfaceId),
      securityGroupId: sg.id,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

* `securityGroupId` - (Required) The ID of the security group.
* `networkInterfaceId` - (Required) The ID of the network interface to attach to.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports no additional attributes.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Network Interface Security Group attachments using the associated network interface ID and security group ID, separated by an underscore (`_`). For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Network Interface Security Group attachments using the associated network interface ID and security group ID, separated by an underscore (`_`). For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_network_interface_sg_attachment.sg_attachment eni-1234567890abcdef0_sg-1234567890abcdef0
```
