import { PinpointApp } from "./.gen/providers/aws/pinpoint-app";
import { PinpointBaiduChannel } from "./.gen/providers/aws/pinpoint-baidu-channel";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const app = new PinpointApp(this, "app", {});
    new PinpointBaiduChannel(this, "channel", {
      apiKey: "",
      applicationId: app.applicationId,
      secretKey: "",

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Pinpoint Baidu Channel using the `application-id`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { PinpointBaiduChannel } from "./.gen/providers/aws/pinpoint-baidu-channel";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    PinpointBaiduChannel.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "channel",
      "application-id"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Pinpoint Baidu Channel using the `application-id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_pinpoint_baidu_channel.channel application-id
```
