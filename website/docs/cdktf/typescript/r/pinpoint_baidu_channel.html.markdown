import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { PinpointBaiduChannel } from "./.gen/providers/aws/pinpoint-baidu-channel";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    PinpointBaiduChannel.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "channel",
      "application-id"
    );
  }
}

```
