```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { PinpointSmsChannel } from "./.gen/providers/aws/pinpoint-sms-channel";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    PinpointSmsChannel.generateConfigForImport(this, "sms", "application-id");
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import the Pinpoint SMS Channel using the `applicationId`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_pinpoint_sms_channel.sms application-id
```
