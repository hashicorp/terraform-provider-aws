import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { PinpointApp } from "./.gen/providers/aws/pinpoint-app";
import { PinpointSmsChannel } from "./.gen/providers/aws/pinpoint-sms-channel";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const app = new PinpointApp(this, "app", {});
    new PinpointSmsChannel(this, "sms", {
      applicationId: app.applicationId,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `applicationId` - (Required) ID of the application.
* `enabled` - (Optional) Whether the channel is enabled or disabled. By default, it is set to `true`.
* `senderId` - (Optional) Identifier of the sender for your messages.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `transactionalMessagesPerSecond` - Maximum number of transactional messages per second that can be sent.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import the Pinpoint SMS Channel using the `applicationId`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { PinpointSmsChannel } from "./.gen/providers/aws/pinpoint-sms-channel";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    PinpointSmsChannel.generateConfigForImport(this, "sms", "application-id");
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import the Pinpoint SMS Channel using the `applicationId`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_pinpoint_sms_channel.sms application-id
```
