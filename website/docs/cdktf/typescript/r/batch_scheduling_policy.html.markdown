# Resource: aws_batch_scheduling_policy

Provides a Batch Scheduling Policy resource.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { BatchSchedulingPolicy } from "./.gen/providers/aws/batch-scheduling-policy";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new BatchSchedulingPolicy(this, "example", {
      fairSharePolicy: {
        computeReservation: 1,
        shareDecaySeconds: 3600,
        shareDistribution: [
          {
            shareIdentifier: "A1*",
            weightFactor: 0.1,
          },
          {
            shareIdentifier: "A2",
            weightFactor: 0.2,
          },
        ],
      },
      name: "example",
      tags: {
        Name: "Example Batch Scheduling Policy",
      },
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `fairshare_policy` - (Optional) A fairshare policy block specifies the `computeReservation`, `share_delay_seconds`, and `shareDistribution` of the scheduling policy. The `fairshare_policy` block is documented below.
* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the scheduling policy.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

A `fairshare_policy` block supports the following arguments:

* `computeReservation` - (Optional) A value used to reserve some of the available maximum vCPU for fair share identifiers that have not yet been used. For more information, see [FairsharePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_FairsharePolicy.html).
* `share_delay_seconds` - (Optional) The time period to use to calculate a fair share percentage for each fair share identifier in use, in seconds. For more information, see [FairsharePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_FairsharePolicy.html).
* `shareDistribution` - (Optional) One or more share distribution blocks which define the weights for the fair share identifiers for the fair share policy. For more information, see [FairsharePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_FairsharePolicy.html). The `shareDistribution` block is documented below.

A `shareDistribution` block supports the following arguments:

* `shareIdentifier` - (Required) A fair share identifier or fair share identifier prefix. For more information, see [ShareAttributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_ShareAttributes.html).
* `weightFactor` - (Optional) The weight factor for the fair share identifier. For more information, see [ShareAttributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_ShareAttributes.html).

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name of the scheduling policy.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Batch Scheduling Policy using the `arn`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { BatchSchedulingPolicy } from "./.gen/providers/aws/batch-scheduling-policy";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    BatchSchedulingPolicy.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "testPolicy",
      "arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:123456789012:scheduling-policy/sample"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Batch Scheduling Policy using the `arn`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_batch_scheduling_policy.test_policy arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:123456789012:scheduling-policy/sample
```
