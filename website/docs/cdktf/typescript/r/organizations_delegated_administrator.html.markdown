```terraform
import {
  to = aws_organizations_delegated_administrator.example
  identity = {
    service_principal    = "config.amazonaws.com"
    delegated_account_id = "123456789012"
  }

resource "aws_organizations_delegated_administrator" "example" {
  ### Configuration omitted for brevity ###
}
```

* `servicePrincipal` (String) Service principal for the AWS service.
* `delegated_account_id` (String) Account ID to be designated as a delegated administrator.

#### Optional

* `accountId` (String) AWS Account where this resource is managed.

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_organizations_delegated_administrator` using the account ID and its service principal. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { OrganizationsDelegatedAdministrator } from "./.gen/providers/aws/organizations-delegated-administrator";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    OrganizationsDelegatedAdministrator.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "123456789012/config.amazonaws.com"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_organizations_delegated_administrator` using the account ID and its service principal. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_organizations_delegated_administrator.example 123456789012/config.amazonaws.com
```
