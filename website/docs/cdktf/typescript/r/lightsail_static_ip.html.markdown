# Resource: aws_lightsail_static_ip

Manages a static IP address.

Use this resource to allocate a static IP address that can be attached to Lightsail instances to provide a consistent public IP address that persists across instance restarts.

~> **Note:** Lightsail is currently only supported in a limited number of AWS Regions, please see ["Regions and Availability Zones in Amazon Lightsail"](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/overview/article/understanding-regions-and-availability-zones-in-amazon-lightsail) for more details.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LightsailStaticIp } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-static-ip";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new LightsailStaticIp(this, "example", {
      name: "example",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `name` - (Required) Name for the allocated static IP.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - ARN of the Lightsail static IP.
* `ipAddress` - Allocated static IP address.
* `supportCode` - Support code for the static IP. Include this code in your email to support when you have questions about a static IP in Lightsail. This code enables our support team to look up your Lightsail information more easily.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_lightsail_static_ip` using the name attribute. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LightsailStaticIp } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-static-ip";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    LightsailStaticIp.generateConfigForImport(this, "example", "example");
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_lightsail_static_ip` using the name attribute. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_lightsail_static_ip.example example
```
