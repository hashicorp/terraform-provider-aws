Provides a Route53 Resolver rule association.

## Example Usage

```typescript

import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Route53ResolverRuleAssociation } from "./.gen/providers/aws/route53-resolver-rule-association";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new Route53ResolverRuleAssociation(this, "example", {
      resolverRuleId: sys.id,
      vpcId: foo.id,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `region` - (Optional) Region where this resource will be [managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints). Defaults to the Region set in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#aws-configuration-reference).

* `vpcId` - (Required) The ID of the VPC that you want to associate the resolver rule with.
* `name` - (Optional) A name for the association that you're creating between a resolver rule and a VPC.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The ID of the resolver rule association.

## Import

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_route53_resolver_rule_association.example
  identity = {
    id = "rslvr-rrassoc-97242eaf88example"
  }
}

resource "aws_route53_resolver_rule_association" "example" {
  ### Configuration omitted for brevity ###
}
```

### Identity Schema

#### Required

* `id` - (String) ID of the Route53 Resolver rule association.

#### Optional

* `accountId` (String) AWS Account where this resource is managed.
* `region` (String) Region where this resource is managed.

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Route53 Resolver rule associations using the `id`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Route53ResolverRuleAssociation } from "./.gen/providers/aws/route53-resolver-rule-association";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    Route53ResolverRuleAssociation.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "rslvr-rrassoc-97242eaf88example"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Route53 Resolver rule associations using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_route53_resolver_rule_association.example rslvr-rrassoc-97242eaf88example
```
