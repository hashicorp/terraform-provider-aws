# Resource: aws_network_acl_association

Provides an network ACL association resource which allows you to associate your network ACL with any subnet(s).

~> **NOTE on Network ACLs and Network ACL Associations:** Terraform provides both a standalone network ACL association resource
and a [network ACL](network_acl.html) resource with a `subnetIds` attribute. Do not use the same subnet ID in both a network ACL
resource and a network ACL association resource. Doing so will cause a conflict of associations and will overwrite the association.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { NetworkAclAssociation } from "./.gen/providers/aws/network-acl-association";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new NetworkAclAssociation(this, "main", {
      networkAclId: Token.asString(awsNetworkAclMain.id),
      subnetId: Token.asString(awsSubnetMain.id),
    });
  }
}

```
