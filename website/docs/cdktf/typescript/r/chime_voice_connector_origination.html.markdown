# Resource: aws_chime_voice_connector_origination

Enable origination settings to control inbound calling to your SIP infrastructure.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ChimeVoiceConnector } from "./.gen/providers/aws/chime-voice-connector";
import { ChimeVoiceConnectorOrigination } from "./.gen/providers/aws/chime-voice-connector-origination";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const defaultVar = new ChimeVoiceConnector(this, "default", {
      name: "test",
      requireEncryption: true,
    });
    const awsChimeVoiceConnectorOriginationDefault =
      new ChimeVoiceConnectorOrigination(this, "default_1", {
        disabled: false,
        route: [
          {
            host: "127.0.0.1",
            port: 8081,
            priority: 1,
            protocol: "TCP",
            weight: 1,
          },
          {
            host: "127.0.0.2",
            port: 8082,
            priority: 2,
            protocol: "TCP",
            weight: 10,
          },
        ],
        voiceConnectorId: defaultVar.id,
      });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsChimeVoiceConnectorOriginationDefault.overrideLogicalId("default");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `voiceConnectorId` - (Required) The Amazon Chime Voice Connector ID.
* `route` - (Required) Set of call distribution properties defined for your SIP hosts. See [route](#route) below for more details. Minimum of 1. Maximum of 20.
* `disabled` - (Optional) When origination settings are disabled, inbound calls are not enabled for your Amazon Chime Voice Connector.

### `route`

Origination routes define call distribution properties for your SIP hosts to receive inbound calls using your Amazon Chime Voice Connector. Limit: Ten origination routes for each Amazon Chime Voice Connector.

* `host` - (Required) The FQDN or IP address to contact for origination traffic.
* `port` - (Required) The designated origination route port. Defaults to `5060`.
* `priority` - (Required) The priority associated with the host, with 1 being the highest priority. Higher priority hosts are attempted first.
* `protocol` - (Required) The protocol to use for the origination route. Encryption-enabled Amazon Chime Voice Connectors use TCP protocol by default.
* `weight` - (Required) The weight associated with the host. If hosts are equal in priority, calls are redistributed among them based on their relative weight.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The Amazon Chime Voice Connector ID.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Chime Voice Connector Origination using the `voiceConnectorId`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Chime Voice Connector Origination using the `voiceConnectorId`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_chime_voice_connector_origination.default abcdef1ghij2klmno3pqr4
```
