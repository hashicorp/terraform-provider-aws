# Resource: aws_amplify_webhook

Provides an Amplify Webhook resource.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { AmplifyApp } from "./.gen/providers/aws/amplify-app";
import { AmplifyBranch } from "./.gen/providers/aws/amplify-branch";
import { AmplifyWebhook } from "./.gen/providers/aws/amplify-webhook";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new AmplifyApp(this, "example", {
      name: "app",
    });
    const master = new AmplifyBranch(this, "master", {
      appId: example.id,
      branchName: "master",
    });
    const awsAmplifyWebhookMaster = new AmplifyWebhook(this, "master_2", {
      appId: example.id,
      branchName: master.branchName,
      description: "triggermaster",
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsAmplifyWebhookMaster.overrideLogicalId("master");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `appId` - (Required) Unique ID for an Amplify app.
* `branchName` - (Required) Name for a branch that is part of the Amplify app.
* `description` - (Optional) Description for a webhook.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - ARN for the webhook.
* `url` - URL of the webhook.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Amplify webhook using a webhook ID. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { AmplifyWebhook } from "./.gen/providers/aws/amplify-webhook";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    AmplifyWebhook.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "master",
      "a26b22a0-748b-4b57-b9a0-ae7e601fe4b1"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Amplify webhook using a webhook ID. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_amplify_webhook.master a26b22a0-748b-4b57-b9a0-ae7e601fe4b1
```
