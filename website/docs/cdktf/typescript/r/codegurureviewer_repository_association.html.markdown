# Resource: aws_codegurureviewer_repository_association

Terraform resource for managing an AWS CodeGuru Reviewer Repository Association.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { CodecommitRepository } from "./.gen/providers/aws/codecommit-repository";
import { CodegurureviewerRepositoryAssociation } from "./.gen/providers/aws/codegurureviewer-repository-association";
import { KmsKey } from "./.gen/providers/aws/kms-key";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new CodecommitRepository(this, "example", {
      lifecycle: {
        ignoreChanges: ["codeguruReviewer"],
      },
      repositoryName: "example-repo",
    });
    const awsKmsKeyExample = new KmsKey(this, "example_1", {});
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsKmsKeyExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
    const awsCodegurureviewerRepositoryAssociationExample =
      new CodegurureviewerRepositoryAssociation(this, "example_2", {
        kmsKeyDetails: {
          encryptionOption: "CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK",
          kmsKeyId: Token.asString(awsKmsKeyExample.keyId),
        },
        repository: {
          codecommit: {
            name: example.repositoryName,
          },
        },
      });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsCodegurureviewerRepositoryAssociationExample.overrideLogicalId(
      "example"
    );
  }
}
