# Resource: aws_route53_resolver_firewall_config

Provides a Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall config resource.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Route53ResolverFirewallConfig } from "./.gen/providers/aws/route53-resolver-firewall-config";
import { Vpc } from "./.gen/providers/aws/vpc";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new Vpc(this, "example", {
      cidrBlock: "10.0.0.0/16",
      enableDnsHostnames: true,
      enableDnsSupport: true,
    });
    const awsRoute53ResolverFirewallConfigExample =
      new Route53ResolverFirewallConfig(this, "example_1", {
        firewallFailOpen: "ENABLED",
        resourceId: example.id,
      });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsRoute53ResolverFirewallConfigExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `resourceId` - (Required) The ID of the VPC that the configuration is for.
* `firewallFailOpen` - (Required) Determines how Route 53 Resolver handles queries during failures, for example when all traffic that is sent to DNS Firewall fails to receive a reply. By default, fail open is disabled, which means the failure mode is closed. This approach favors security over availability. DNS Firewall blocks queries that it is unable to evaluate properly. If you enable this option, the failure mode is open. This approach favors availability over security. DNS Firewall allows queries to proceed if it is unable to properly evaluate them. Valid values: `ENABLED`, `DISABLED`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The ID of the firewall configuration.
* `ownerId` - The AWS account ID of the owner of the VPC that this firewall configuration applies to.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall configs using the Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall config ID. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Route53ResolverFirewallConfig } from "./.gen/providers/aws/route53-resolver-firewall-config";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    Route53ResolverFirewallConfig.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "rdsc-be1866ecc1683e95"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall configs using the Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall config ID. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_route53_resolver_firewall_config.example rdsc-be1866ecc1683e95
```
