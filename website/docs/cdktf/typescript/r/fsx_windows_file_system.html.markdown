Manages a FSx Windows File System. See the [FSx Windows Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/what-is.html) for more information.

~> **NOTE:** Either the `activeDirectoryId` argument or `selfManagedActiveDirectory` configuration block must be specified.

## Example Usage

### Using AWS Directory Service

Additional information for using AWS Directory Service with Windows File Systems can be found in the [FSx Windows Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/fsx-aws-managed-ad.html).

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { FsxWindowsFileSystem } from "./.gen/providers/aws/fsx-windows-file-system";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new FsxWindowsFileSystem(this, "example", {
      activeDirectoryId: Token.asString(awsDirectoryServiceDirectoryExample.id),
      kmsKeyId: Token.asString(awsKmsKeyExample.arn),
      storageCapacity: 300,
      subnetIds: [Token.asString(awsSubnetExample.id)],
      throughputCapacity: 1024,
    });
  }
}

```

### Using a Self-Managed Microsoft Active Directory

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - Amazon Resource Name of the file system.
* `dnsName` - DNS name for the file system, e.g., `fs-12345678.corp.example.com` (domain name matching the Active Directory domain name)
* `id` - Identifier of the file system (e.g. `fs-12345678`).
* `networkInterfaceIds` - Set of Elastic Network Interface identifiers from which the file system is accessible.
* `ownerId` - AWS account identifier that created the file system.
* `preferredFileServerIp` - The IP address of the primary, or preferred, file server.
* `remoteAdministrationEndpoint` - For `MULTI_AZ_1` deployment types, use this endpoint when performing administrative tasks on the file system using Amazon FSx Remote PowerShell. For `SINGLE_AZ_1` deployment types, this is the DNS name of the file system.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).
* `vpcId` - Identifier of the Virtual Private Cloud for the file system.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `create` - (Default `45m`)
* `delete` - (Default `30m`)
* `update` - (Default `45m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import FSx File Systems using the `id`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import FSx File Systems using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_fsx_windows_file_system.example fs-543ab12b1ca672f33
```

Certain resource arguments, like `securityGroupIds` and the `selfManagedActiveDirectory` configuation block `password`, do not have a FSx API method for reading the information after creation. If these arguments are set in the Terraform configuration on an imported resource, Terraform will always show a difference. To workaround this behavior, either omit the argument from the Terraform configuration or use [`ignoreChanges`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/meta-arguments/lifecycle.html#ignore_changes) to hide the difference. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { FsxWindowsFileSystem } from "./.gen/providers/aws/fsx-windows-file-system";
interface MyConfig {
  subnetIds: any;
  throughputCapacity: any;
}
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string, config: MyConfig) {
    super(scope, name);
    new FsxWindowsFileSystem(this, "example", {
      lifecycle: {
        ignoreChanges: [securityGroupIds],
      },
      securityGroupIds: [Token.asString(awsSecurityGroupExample.id)],
      subnetIds: config.subnetIds,
      throughputCapacity: config.throughputCapacity,
    });
  }
}

```
