# Resource: aws_ram_principal_association

Provides a Resource Access Manager (RAM) principal association. Depending if [RAM Sharing with AWS Organizations is enabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/getting-started-sharing.html#getting-started-sharing-orgs), the RAM behavior with different principal types changes.

When RAM Sharing with AWS Organizations is enabled:

- For AWS Account ID, Organization, and Organizational Unit principals within the same AWS Organization, no resource share invitation is sent and resources become available automatically after creating the association.
- For AWS Account ID principals outside the AWS Organization, a resource share invitation is sent and must be accepted before resources become available. See the [`aws_ram_resource_share_accepter` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/ram_resource_share_accepter.html) to accept these invitations.

When RAM Sharing with AWS Organizations is not enabled:

- Organization and Organizational Unit principals cannot be used.
- For AWS Account ID principals, a resource share invitation is sent and must be accepted before resources become available. See the [`aws_ram_resource_share_accepter` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/ram_resource_share_accepter.html) to accept these invitations.

## Example Usage

### AWS Account ID

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { RamPrincipalAssociation } from "./.gen/providers/aws/ram-principal-association";
import { RamResourceShare } from "./.gen/providers/aws/ram-resource-share";
interface MyConfig {
  name: any;
}
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string, config: MyConfig) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new RamResourceShare(this, "example", {
      allowExternalPrincipals: true,
      name: config.name,
    });
    const awsRamPrincipalAssociationExample = new RamPrincipalAssociation(
      this,
      "example_1",
      {
        principal: "111111111111",
        resourceShareArn: example.arn,
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsRamPrincipalAssociationExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

### AWS Organization

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { RamPrincipalAssociation } from "./.gen/providers/aws/ram-principal-association";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new RamPrincipalAssociation(this, "example", {
      principal: Token.asString(awsOrganizationsOrganizationExample.arn),
      resourceShareArn: Token.asString(awsRamResourceShareExample.arn),
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `principal` - (Required) The principal to associate with the resource share. Possible values are an AWS account ID, an AWS Organizations Organization ARN, or an AWS Organizations Organization Unit ARN.
* `resourceShareArn` - (Required) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource share.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Resource Share and the principal, separated by a comma.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import RAM Principal Associations using their Resource Share ARN and the `principal` separated by a comma. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { RamPrincipalAssociation } from "./.gen/providers/aws/ram-principal-association";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    RamPrincipalAssociation.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "arn:aws:ram:eu-west-1:123456789012:resource-share/73da1ab9-b94a-4ba3-8eb4-45917f7f4b12,123456789012"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import RAM Principal Associations using their Resource Share ARN and the `principal` separated by a comma. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_ram_principal_association.example arn:aws:ram:eu-west-1:123456789012:resource-share/73da1ab9-b94a-4ba3-8eb4-45917f7f4b12,123456789012
```
