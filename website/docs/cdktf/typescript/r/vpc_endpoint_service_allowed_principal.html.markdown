# Resource: aws_vpc_endpoint_service_allowed_principal

Provides a resource to allow a principal to discover a VPC endpoint service.

~> **NOTE on VPC Endpoint Services and VPC Endpoint Service Allowed Principals:** Terraform provides
both a standalone [VPC Endpoint Service Allowed Principal](vpc_endpoint_service_allowed_principal.html) resource
and a VPC Endpoint Service resource with an `allowedPrincipals` attribute. Do not use the same principal ARN in both
a VPC Endpoint Service resource and a VPC Endpoint Service Allowed Principal resource. Doing so will cause a conflict
and will overwrite the association.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsCallerIdentity } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-caller-identity";
import { VpcEndpointServiceAllowedPrincipal } from "./.gen/providers/aws/vpc-endpoint-service-allowed-principal";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const current = new DataAwsCallerIdentity(this, "current", {});
    new VpcEndpointServiceAllowedPrincipal(this, "allow_me_to_foo", {
      principalArn: Token.asString(current.arn),
      vpcEndpointServiceId: foo.id,
    });
  }
}

```

* `vpcEndpointServiceId` - (Required) The ID of the VPC endpoint service to allow permission.
