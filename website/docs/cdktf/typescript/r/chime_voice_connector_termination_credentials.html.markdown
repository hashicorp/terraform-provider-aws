# Resource: aws_chime_voice_connector_termination_credentials

Adds termination SIP credentials for the specified Amazon Chime Voice Connector.

~> **Note:** Voice Connector Termination Credentials requires a [Voice Connector Termination](/docs/providers/aws/r/chime_voice_connector_termination.html) to be present. Use of `dependsOn` (as shown below) is recommended to avoid race conditions.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ChimeVoiceConnector } from "./.gen/providers/aws/chime-voice-connector";
import { ChimeVoiceConnectorTermination } from "./.gen/providers/aws/chime-voice-connector-termination";
import { ChimeVoiceConnectorTerminationCredentials } from "./.gen/providers/aws/chime-voice-connector-termination-credentials";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const defaultVar = new ChimeVoiceConnector(this, "default", {
      name: "test",
      requireEncryption: true,
    });
    const awsChimeVoiceConnectorTerminationDefault =
      new ChimeVoiceConnectorTermination(this, "default_1", {
        callingRegions: ["US", "CA"],
        cidrAllowList: ["50.35.78.96/31"],
        cpsLimit: 1,
        disabled: true,
        voiceConnectorId: defaultVar.id,
      });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsChimeVoiceConnectorTerminationDefault.overrideLogicalId("default");
    const awsChimeVoiceConnectorTerminationCredentialsDefault =
      new ChimeVoiceConnectorTerminationCredentials(this, "default_2", {
        credentials: [
          {
            password: "test!",
            username: "test",
          },
        ],
        dependsOn: [awsChimeVoiceConnectorTerminationDefault],
        voiceConnectorId: defaultVar.id,
      });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsChimeVoiceConnectorTerminationCredentialsDefault.overrideLogicalId(
      "default"
    );
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `voiceConnectorId` - (Required) Amazon Chime Voice Connector ID.
* `credentials` - (Required) List of termination SIP credentials.

### `credentials`

The SIP credentials used to authenticate requests to your Amazon Chime Voice Connector.

* `username` - (Required) RFC2617 compliant username associated with the SIP credentials.
* `password` - (Required) RFC2617 compliant password associated with the SIP credentials.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - Amazon Chime Voice Connector ID.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Chime Voice Connector Termination Credentials using the `voiceConnectorId`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Chime Voice Connector Termination Credentials using the `voiceConnectorId`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_chime_voice_connector_termination_credentials.default abcdef1ghij2klmno3pqr4
```
