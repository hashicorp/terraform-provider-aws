# Resource: aws_kms_replica_key

Manages a KMS multi-Region replica key.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { KmsKey } from "./.gen/providers/aws/kms-key";
import { KmsReplicaKey } from "./.gen/providers/aws/kms-replica-key";
import { AwsProvider } from "./.gen/providers/aws/provider";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const primary = new AwsProvider(this, "aws", {
      alias: "primary",
      region: "us-east-1",
    });
    new AwsProvider(this, "aws_1", {
      region: "us-west-2",
    });
    const awsKmsKeyPrimary = new KmsKey(this, "primary", {
      deletionWindowInDays: 30,
      description: "Multi-Region primary key",
      multiRegion: true,
      provider: primary,
    });
    new KmsReplicaKey(this, "replica", {
      deletionWindowInDays: 7,
      description: "Multi-Region replica key",
      primaryKeyArn: Token.asString(awsKmsKeyPrimary.arn),
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `bypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck` - (Optional) A flag to indicate whether to bypass the key policy lockout safety check.
Setting this value to true increases the risk that the KMS key becomes unmanageable. Do not set this value to true indiscriminately.
For more information, refer to the scenario in the [Default Key Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam) section in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.
The default value is `false`.
* `deletionWindowInDays` - (Optional) The waiting period, specified in number of days. After the waiting period ends, AWS KMS deletes the KMS key.
If you specify a value, it must be between `7` and `30`, inclusive. If you do not specify a value, it defaults to `30`.
* `description` - (Optional) A description of the KMS key.
* `enabled` - (Optional) Specifies whether the replica key is enabled. Disabled KMS keys cannot be used in cryptographic operations. The default value is `true`.
* `policy` - (Optional) The key policy to attach to the KMS key. If you do not specify a key policy, AWS KMS attaches the [default key policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default) to the KMS key.
For more information about building policy documents with Terraform, see the [AWS IAM Policy Document Guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/aws/iam-policy).
* `primaryKeyArn` - (Required) The ARN of the multi-Region primary key to replicate. The primary key must be in a different AWS Region of the same AWS Partition. You can create only one replica of a given primary key in each AWS Region.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the replica key. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replica key. The key ARNs of related multi-Region keys differ only in the Region value.
* `keyId` - The key ID of the replica key. Related multi-Region keys have the same key ID.
* `keyRotationEnabled` - A Boolean value that specifies whether key rotation is enabled. This is a shared property of multi-Region keys.
* `keySpec` - The type of key material in the KMS key. This is a shared property of multi-Region keys.
* `keyUsage` - The [cryptographic operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations) for which you can use the KMS key. This is a shared property of multi-Region keys.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import KMS multi-Region replica keys using the `id`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import KMS multi-Region replica keys using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_kms_replica_key.example 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
```
