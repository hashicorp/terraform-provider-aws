# Resource: aws_costoptimizationhub_enrollment_status

Terraform resource for managing AWS Cost Optimization Hub Enrollment Status.

-> **TIP:** The Cost Optimization Hub only has a `us-east-1` endpoint. However, you can access the service globally with the AWS Provider from other regions. Other tools, such as the [AWS CLI](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cost-optimization-hub/index.html), may require you to specify the `us-east-1` region when using the service.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { CostoptimizationhubEnrollmentStatus } from "./.gen/providers/aws/costoptimizationhub-enrollment-status";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new CostoptimizationhubEnrollmentStatus(this, "example", {});
  }
}

```

### Usage with all the arguments

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { CostoptimizationhubEnrollmentStatus } from "./.gen/providers/aws/costoptimizationhub-enrollment-status";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new CostoptimizationhubEnrollmentStatus(this, "example", {
      includeMemberAccounts: true,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are optional:

* `includeMemberAccounts` - (Optional) Flag to enroll member accounts of the organization if the account is the management account. No drift detection is currently supported for this argument. Default value is `false`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `status` - Status of enrollment. When the resource is present in Terraform, its status will always be `Active`.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Cost Optimization Hub Enrollment Status using your AWS account ID. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { CostoptimizationhubEnrollmentStatus } from "./.gen/providers/aws/costoptimizationhub-enrollment-status";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    CostoptimizationhubEnrollmentStatus.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "111222333444"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Cost Optimization Hub Enrollment Status using your AWS account ID. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_costoptimizationhub_enrollment_status.example 111222333444
```
