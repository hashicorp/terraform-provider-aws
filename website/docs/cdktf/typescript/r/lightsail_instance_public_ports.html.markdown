# Resource: aws_lightsail_instance_public_ports

Opens ports for a specific Amazon Lightsail instance, and specifies the IP addresses allowed to connect to the instance through the ports, and the protocol.

-> See [What is Amazon Lightsail?](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/getting-started/article/what-is-amazon-lightsail) for more information.

~> **Note:** Lightsail is currently only supported in a limited number of AWS Regions, please see ["Regions and Availability Zones in Amazon Lightsail"](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/overview/article/understanding-regions-and-availability-zones-in-amazon-lightsail) for more details.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Fn, Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LightsailInstance } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-instance";
import { LightsailInstancePublicPorts } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-instance-public-ports";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const test = new LightsailInstance(this, "test", {
      availabilityZone: Token.asString(Fn.lookupNested(available.names, ["0"])),
      blueprintId: "amazon_linux_2",
      bundleId: "nano_1_0",
      name: "yak_sail",
    });
    const awsLightsailInstancePublicPortsTest =
      new LightsailInstancePublicPorts(this, "test_1", {
        instanceName: test.name,
        portInfo: [
          {
            fromPort: 80,
            protocol: "tcp",
            toPort: 80,
          },
        ],
      });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsLightsailInstancePublicPortsTest.overrideLogicalId("test");
  }
}

```
