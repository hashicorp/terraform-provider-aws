## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import AppFlow Connector Profile using the connector profile `arn`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { AppflowConnectorProfile } from "./.gen/providers/aws/appflow-connector-profile";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    AppflowConnectorProfile.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "profile",
      "arn:aws:appflow:us-west-2:123456789012:connectorprofile/example-profile"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import AppFlow Connector Profile using the connector profile `arn`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_appflow_connector_profile.profile arn:aws:appflow:us-west-2:123456789012:connectorprofile/example-profile
```
