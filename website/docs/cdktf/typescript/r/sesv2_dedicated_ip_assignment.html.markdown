# Resource: aws_sesv2_dedicated_ip_assignment

Terraform resource for managing an AWS SESv2 (Simple Email V2) Dedicated IP Assignment.

This resource is used with "Standard" dedicated IP addresses. This includes addresses [requested and relinquished manually](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/dedicated-ip-case.html) via an AWS support case, or [Bring Your Own IP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/dedicated-ip-byo.html) addresses. Once no longer assigned, this resource returns the IP to the [`ses-default-dedicated-pool`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/managing-ip-pools.html), managed by AWS.

 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Sesv2DedicatedIpAssignment } from "./.gen/providers/aws/sesv2-dedicated-ip-assignment";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new Sesv2DedicatedIpAssignment(this, "example", {
      destinationPoolName: "my-pool",
      ip: "0.0.0.0",
    });

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import SESv2 (Simple Email V2) Dedicated IP Assignment using the `id`, which is a comma-separated string made up of `ip` and `destinationPoolName`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Sesv2DedicatedIpAssignment } from "./.gen/providers/aws/sesv2-dedicated-ip-assignment";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    Sesv2DedicatedIpAssignment.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "0.0.0.0,my-pool"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import SESv2 (Simple Email V2) Dedicated IP Assignment using the `id`, which is a comma-separated string made up of `ip` and `destinationPoolName`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_sesv2_dedicated_ip_assignment.example "0.0.0.0,my-pool"
