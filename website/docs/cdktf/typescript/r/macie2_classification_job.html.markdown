# Resource: aws_macie2_classification_job

Provides a resource to manage an [AWS Macie Classification Job](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/APIReference/jobs.html).

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Macie2Account } from "./.gen/providers/aws/macie2-account";
import { Macie2ClassificationJob } from "./.gen/providers/aws/macie2-classification-job";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const test = new Macie2Account(this, "test", {});
    const awsMacie2ClassificationJobTest = new Macie2ClassificationJob(
      this,
      "test_1",
      {
        dependsOn: [test],
        jobType: "ONE_TIME",
        name: "NAME OF THE CLASSIFICATION JOB",
        s3JobDefinition: {
          bucketDefinitions: [
            {
              accountId: "ACCOUNT ID",
              buckets: ["S3 BUCKET NAME"],
            },
          ],
        },
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsMacie2ClassificationJobTest.overrideLogicalId("test");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `scheduleFrequency` -  (Optional) The recurrence pattern for running the job. To run the job only once, don't specify a value for this property and set the value for the `jobType` property to `ONE_TIME`. (documented below)
* `customDataIdentifierIds` -  (Optional) The custom data identifiers to use for data analysis and classification.
* `samplingPercentage` -  (Optional) The sampling depth, as a percentage, to apply when processing objects. This value determines the percentage of eligible objects that the job analyzes. If this value is less than 100, Amazon Macie selects the objects to analyze at random, up to the specified percentage, and analyzes all the data in those objects.
* `name` -  (Optional) A custom name for the job. The name can contain as many as 500 characters. If omitted, Terraform will assign a random, unique name. Conflicts with `namePrefix`.
* `namePrefix` -  (Optional) Creates a unique name beginning with the specified prefix. Conflicts with `name`.
* `description` -  (Optional) A custom description of the job. The description can contain as many as 200 characters.
* `initialRun` -  (Optional) Specifies whether to analyze all existing, eligible objects immediately after the job is created.
* `jobType` -  (Required) The schedule for running the job. Valid values are: `ONE_TIME` - Run the job only once. If you specify this value, don't specify a value for the `scheduleFrequency` property. `SCHEDULED` - Run the job on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. If you specify this value, use the `scheduleFrequency` property to define the recurrence pattern for the job.
* `s3JobDefinition` -  (Optional) The S3 buckets that contain the objects to analyze, and the scope of that analysis. (documented below)
* `tags` -  (Optional) A map of key-value pairs that specifies the tags to associate with the job. A job can have a maximum of 50 tags. Each tag consists of a tag key and an associated tag value. The maximum length of a tag key is 128 characters. The maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters.
* `jobStatus` -  (Optional) The status for the job. Valid values are: `CANCELLED`, `RUNNING` and `USER_PAUSED`

The `scheduleFrequency` object supports the following:

* `dailySchedule` -  (Optional) Specifies a daily recurrence pattern for running the job.

* `scoping` -  (Optional) The property- and tag-based conditions that determine which objects to include or exclude from the analysis. (documented below)

* `userPausedDetails` - If the current status of the job is `USER_PAUSED`, specifies when the job was paused and when the job or job run will expire and be canceled if it isn't resumed. This value is present only if the value for `job-status` is `USER_PAUSED`.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_macie2_classification_job` using the id. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Macie2ClassificationJob } from "./.gen/providers/aws/macie2-classification-job";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    Macie2ClassificationJob.generateConfigForImport(this, "example", "abcd1");
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_macie2_classification_job` using the id. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_macie2_classification_job.example abcd1
```
