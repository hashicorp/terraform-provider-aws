# Resource: aws_backup_restore_testing_plan

Terraform resource for managing an AWS Backup Restore Testing Plan.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { BackupRestoreTestingPlan } from "./.gen/providers/aws/backup-restore-testing-plan";
interface MyConfig {
  name: any;
}
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string, config: MyConfig) {
    super(scope, name);
    new BackupRestoreTestingPlan(this, "example", {
      recoveryPointSelection: [
        {
          algorithm: "LATEST_WITHIN_WINDOW",
          includeVaults: ["*"],
          recoveryPointTypes: ["CONTINUOUS"],
        },
      ],
      scheduleExpression: "cron(0 12 ? * * *)",
      name: config.name,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `name` (Required): The name of the restore testing plan. Must be between 1 and 50 characters long and contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
* `scheduleExpression` (Required): The schedule expression for the restore testing plan.
* `scheduleExpressionTimezone` (Optional): The timezone for the schedule expression. If not provided, the state value will be used.
* `startWindowHours` (Optional): The number of hours in the start window for the restore testing plan. Must be between 1 and 168.
* `recoveryPointSelection` (Required): Specifies the recovery point selection configuration. See [RecoveryPointSelection](#recoverypointselection) section for more details.

### RecoveryPointSelection

* `algorithm` (Required): Specifies the algorithm used for selecting recovery points. Valid values are "RANDOM_WITHIN_WINDOW" and "LATEST_WITHIN_WINDOW".
* `includeVaults` (Required): Specifies the backup vaults to include in the recovery point selection. Each value must be a valid AWS ARN for a backup vault or "*" to include all backup vaults.
* `recoveryPointTypes` (Required): Specifies the types of recovery points to include in the selection. Valid values are "CONTINUOUS" and "SNAPSHOT".
* `excludeVaults` (Optional): Specifies the backup vaults to exclude from the recovery point selection. Each value must be a valid AWS ARN for a backup vault or "*" to exclude all backup vaults.
* `selectionWindowDays` (Optional): Specifies the number of days within which the recovery points should be selected. Must be a value between 1 and 365.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - ARN of the Restore Testing Plan.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Backup Restore Testing Plan using the `name`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { BackupRestoreTestingPlan } from "./.gen/providers/aws/backup-restore-testing-plan";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    BackupRestoreTestingPlan.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "my_testing_plan"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Backup Restore Testing Plan using the `name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_backup_restore_testing_plan.example my_testing_plan
```
