# Resource: aws_scheduler_schedule

Provides an EventBridge Scheduler Schedule resource.

You can find out more about EventBridge Scheduler in the [User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/scheduler/latest/UserGuide/what-is-scheduler.html).

~> **Note:** EventBridge was formerly known as CloudWatch Events. The functionality is identical.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { SchedulerSchedule } from "./.gen/providers/aws/scheduler-schedule";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new SchedulerSchedule(this, "example", {
      flexibleTimeWindow: {
        mode: "OFF",
      },
      groupName: "default",
      name: "my-schedule",
      scheduleExpression: "rate(1 hours)",
      target: {
        arn: Token.asString(awsSqsQueueExample.arn),
        roleArn: Token.asString(awsIamRoleExample.arn),
      },
    });
  }
}

```

### Universal Target

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Fn, Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.

    const example = new SqsQueue(this, "example", {});
    const awsSchedulerScheduleExample = new SchedulerSchedule(
      this,
      "example_1",
      {
        flexibleTimeWindow: {
          mode: "OFF",
        },
        name: "my-schedule",
        scheduleExpression: "rate(1 hours)",
        target: {
          arn: "arn:aws:scheduler:::aws-sdk:sqs:sendMessage",
          input: Token.asString(
            Fn.jsonencode({

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `flexibleTimeWindow` - (Required) Configures a time window during which EventBridge Scheduler invokes the schedule. Detailed below.
* `scheduleExpression` - (Required) Defines when the schedule runs. Read more in [Schedule types on EventBridge Scheduler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/scheduler/latest/UserGuide/schedule-types.html).

The following arguments are optional:

* `description` - (Optional) Brief description of the schedule.
* `endDate` - (Optional) The date, in UTC, before which the schedule can invoke its target. Depending on the schedule's recurrence expression, invocations might stop on, or before, the end date you specify. EventBridge Scheduler ignores the end date for one-time schedules. Example: `2030-01-01T01:00:00Z`.
* `groupName` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Name of the schedule group to associate with this schedule. When omitted, the `default` schedule group is used.
* `kmsKeyArn` - (Optional) ARN for the customer managed KMS key that EventBridge Scheduler will use to encrypt and decrypt your data.
* `name` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Name of the schedule. If omitted, Terraform will assign a random, unique name. Conflicts with `name_prefix`.
* `namePrefix` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Creates a unique name beginning with the specified prefix. Conflicts with `name`.
* `scheduleExpressionTimezone` - (Optional) Timezone in which the scheduling expression is evaluated. Defaults to `UTC`. Example: `Australia/Sydney`.
* `startDate` - (Optional) The date, in UTC, after which the schedule can begin invoking its target. Depending on the schedule's recurrence expression, invocations might occur on, or after, the start date you specify. EventBridge Scheduler ignores the start date for one-time schedules. Example: `2030-01-01T01:00:00Z`.
* `state` - (Optional) Specifies whether the schedule is enabled or disabled. One of: `ENABLED` (default), `DISABLED`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - Name of the schedule.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import schedules using the combination `groupName/name`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import schedules using the combination `groupName/name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_scheduler_schedule.example my-schedule-group/my-schedule
```
