# Resource: aws_resiliencehub_resiliency_policy

Terraform resource for managing an AWS Resilience Hub Resiliency Policy.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ResiliencehubResiliencyPolicy } from "./.gen/providers/aws/resiliencehub-resiliency-policy";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new ResiliencehubResiliencyPolicy(this, "example", {
      dataLocationConstraint: "AnyLocation",
      description: "testexample",
      name: "testexample",
      policy: [
        {
          az: [
            {
              rpo: "24h",
              rto: "24h",
            },
          ],
          hardware: [
            {

          ],
        },
      ],
      tier: "NonCritical",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `name` (String) Name of Resiliency Policy.
  Must be between 2 and 60 characters long.
  Must start with an alphanumeric character and contain alphanumeric characters, underscores, or hyphens.
* `tier` (String) Resiliency Policy Tier.
  Valid values are `MissionCritical`, `Critical`, `Important`, `CoreServices`, `NonCritical`, and `NotApplicable`.
* `policy` (Attributes) The type of resiliency policy to be created, including the recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) in seconds. See [`policy`](#policy).

The following arguments are optional:

* `description` (String) Description of Resiliency Policy.
* `dataLocationConstraint` (String) Data Location Constraint of the Policy.
  Valid values are `AnyLocation`, `SameContinent`, and `SameCountry`.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Resilience Hub Resiliency Policy using the `arn`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ResiliencehubResiliencyPolicy } from "./.gen/providers/aws/resiliencehub-resiliency-policy";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    ResiliencehubResiliencyPolicy.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "arn:aws:resiliencehub:us-east-1:123456789012:resiliency-policy/8c1cfa29-d1dd-4421-aa68-c9f64cced4c2"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Resilience Hub Resiliency Policy using the `arn`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_resiliencehub_resiliency_policy.example arn:aws:resiliencehub:us-east-1:123456789012:resiliency-policy/8c1cfa29-d1dd-4421-aa68-c9f64cced4c2
```
