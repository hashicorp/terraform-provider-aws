## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Backup Report Plan using the `id` which corresponds to the name of the Backup Report Plan. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { BackupReportPlan } from "./.gen/providers/aws/backup-report-plan";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    BackupReportPlan.generateConfigForImport(this, "test", "<id>");
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Backup Report Plan using the `id` which corresponds to the name of the Backup Report Plan. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_backup_report_plan.test <id>
```
