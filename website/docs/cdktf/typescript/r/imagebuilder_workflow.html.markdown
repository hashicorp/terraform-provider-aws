# Resource: aws_imagebuilder_workflow

Terraform resource for managing an AWS EC2 Image Builder Workflow.

-> Image Builder manages the workflows for the distribution stage. Therefore, using the DISTRIBUTION workflow type results in an error.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ImagebuilderWorkflow } from "./.gen/providers/aws/imagebuilder-workflow";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new ImagebuilderWorkflow(this, "example", {
      data: 'name: example\ndescription: Workflow to test an image\nschemaVersion: 1.0\n\nparameters:\n  - name: waitForActionAtEnd\n    type: boolean\n\nsteps:\n  - name: LaunchTestInstance\n    action: LaunchInstance\n    onFailure: Abort\n    inputs:\n      waitFor: "ssmAgent"\n\n  - name: TerminateTestInstance\n    action: TerminateInstance\n    onFailure: Continue\n    inputs:\n      instanceId.$: "$.stepOutputs.LaunchTestInstance.instanceId"\n\n  - name: WaitForActionAtEnd\n    action: WaitForAction\n    if:\n      booleanEquals: true\n      value: "$.parameters.waitForActionAtEnd"\n\n',
      name: "example",
      type: "TEST",
      version: "1.0.0",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the workflow.
* `type` - (Required) Type of the workflow. Valid values: `BUILD`, `TEST`.
* `version` - (Required) Version of the workflow.

The following arguments are optional:

* `changeDescription` - (Optional) Change description of the workflow.
* `data` - (Optional) Inline YAML string with data of the workflow. Exactly one of `data` and `uri` can be specified.
* `description` - (Optional) Description of the workflow.
* `kmsKeyId` - (Optional) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Key Management Service (KMS) Key used to encrypt the workflow.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags for the workflow. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `uri` - (Optional) S3 URI with data of the workflow. Exactly one of `data` and `uri` can be specified.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the workflow.
* `dateCreated` - Date the workflow was created.
* `owner` - Owner of the workflow.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import EC2 Image Builder Workflow using the `example_id_arg`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ImagebuilderWorkflow } from "./.gen/providers/aws/imagebuilder-workflow";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    ImagebuilderWorkflow.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "workflow-id-12345678"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import EC2 Image Builder Workflow using the `example_id_arg`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_imagebuilder_workflow.example arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-east-1:aws:workflow/test/example/1.0.1/1
```

Certain resource arguments, such as `uri`, cannot be read via the API and imported into Terraform. Terraform will display a difference for these arguments the first run after import if declared in the Terraform configuration for an imported resource.
