```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { AccountPrimaryContact } from "./.gen/providers/aws/account-primary-contact";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    AccountPrimaryContact.generateConfigForImport(this, "test", "1234567890");
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import the Primary Contact using the `accountId`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_account_primary_contact.test 1234567890
```
