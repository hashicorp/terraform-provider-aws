# Resource: aws_networkmanager_dx_gateway_attachment

Terraform resource for managing an AWS Network Manager Direct Connect (DX) Gateway Attachment.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { NetworkmanagerDxGatewayAttachment } from "./.gen/providers/aws/networkmanager-dx-gateway-attachment";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new NetworkmanagerDxGatewayAttachment(this, "test", {
      coreNetworkId: Token.asString(
        awsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkPolicyAttachmentTest.coreNetworkId
      ),
      directConnectGatewayArn:
        "arn:aws:directconnect::${" +
        current.accountId +
        "}:dx-gateway/${" +
        awsDxGatewayTest.id +
        "}",
      edgeLocations: [Token.asString(dataAwsRegionCurrent.name)],
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `coreNetworkArn` - ARN of the core network for the attachment.
* `id` - The ID of the attachment.
* `ownerAccountId` - ID of the attachment account owner.
* `segmentName` - Name of the segment attachment.
* `state` - State of the attachment.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

* `delete` - (Default `30m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Network Manager DX Gateway Attachment using the `id`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { NetworkmanagerDxGatewayAttachment } from "./.gen/providers/aws/networkmanager-dx-gateway-attachment";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    NetworkmanagerDxGatewayAttachment.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "attachment-1a2b3c4d5e6f7g"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Network Manager DX Gateway Attachment using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_networkmanager_dx_gateway_attachment.example attachment-1a2b3c4d5e6f7g
```
