Use this resource to create and manage a Direct Connect Gateway attachment to a Cloud WAN core network.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { NetworkmanagerDxGatewayAttachment } from "./.gen/providers/aws/networkmanager-dx-gateway-attachment";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new NetworkmanagerDxGatewayAttachment(this, "test", {
      coreNetworkId: Token.asString(
        awsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkPolicyAttachmentTest.coreNetworkId
      ),
      directConnectGatewayArn:
        "arn:aws:directconnect::${" +
        current.accountId +
        "}:dx-gateway/${" +
        awsDxGatewayTest.id +
        "}",
      edgeLocations: [Token.asString(dataAwsRegionCurrent.region)],
    });
  }
}

```

* `delete` - (Default `30m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Network Manager DX Gateway Attachment using the `id`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { NetworkmanagerDxGatewayAttachment } from "./.gen/providers/aws/networkmanager-dx-gateway-attachment";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    NetworkmanagerDxGatewayAttachment.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "attachment-1a2b3c4d5e6f7g"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Network Manager DX Gateway Attachment using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_networkmanager_dx_gateway_attachment.example attachment-1a2b3c4d5e6f7g
```
