# Resource: aws_iam_organizations_features

Manages centralized root access features across AWS member accounts managed using AWS Organizations. More information about managing root access in IAM can be found in the [Centralize root access for member accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-enable-root-access.html).

~> **NOTE:** The AWS account utilizing this resource must be an Organizations management account. Also, you must enable trusted access for AWS Identity and Access Management in AWS Organizations.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { IamOrganizationsFeatures } from "./.gen/providers/aws/iam-organizations-features";
import { OrganizationsOrganization } from "./.gen/providers/aws/organizations-organization";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new IamOrganizationsFeatures(this, "example", {
      enabledFeatures: ["RootCredentialsManagement", "RootSessions"],
    });
    const awsOrganizationsOrganizationExample = new OrganizationsOrganization(
      this,
      "example_1",
      {
        awsServiceAccessPrincipals: ["iam.amazonaws.com"],
        featureSet: "ALL",
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsOrganizationsOrganizationExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `enabledFeatures` - (Required) List of IAM features to enable. Valid values are `RootCredentialsManagement` and `RootSessions`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - AWS Organization identifier.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import root access features using the `id`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { IamOrganizationsFeatures } from "./.gen/providers/aws/iam-organizations-features";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    IamOrganizationsFeatures.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "o-1234567"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import root access features using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_iam_organizations_features.example o-1234567
```
