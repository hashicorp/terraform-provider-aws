# Resource: aws_lambda_layer_version

Provides a Lambda Layer Version resource. Lambda Layers allow you to reuse shared bits of code across multiple lambda functions.

For information about Lambda Layers and how to use them, see [AWS Lambda Layers][1].

~> **NOTE:** Setting `skipDestroy` to `true` means that the AWS Provider will _not_ destroy any layer version, even when running `terraform destroy`. Layer versions are thus intentional dangling resources that are _not_ managed by Terraform and may incur extra expense in your AWS account.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LambdaLayerVersion } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lambda-layer-version";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new LambdaLayerVersion(this, "lambda_layer", {
      compatibleRuntimes: ["nodejs16.x"],
      filename: "lambda_layer_payload.zip",
      layerName: "lambda_layer_name",
    });
  }
}

```

## Specifying the Deployment Package

AWS Lambda Layers expect source code to be provided as a deployment package whose structure varies depending on which `compatibleRuntimes` this layer specifies.
See [Runtimes][2] for the valid values of `compatibleRuntimes`.

Once you have created your deployment package you can specify it either directly as a local file (using the `filename` argument) or
indirectly via Amazon S3 (using the `s3Bucket`, `s3Key` and `s3ObjectVersion` arguments). When providing the deployment
package via S3 it may be useful to use [the `awsS3Object` resource](s3_object.html) to upload it.

For larger deployment packages it is recommended by Amazon to upload via S3, since the S3 API has better support for uploading large files efficiently.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `layerName` - (Required) Unique name for your Lambda Layer

The following arguments are optional:

* `compatibleArchitectures` - (Optional) List of [Architectures][4] this layer is compatible with. Currently `x8664` and `arm64` can be specified.
* `compatibleRuntimes` - (Optional) List of [Runtimes][2] this layer is compatible with. Up to 5 runtimes can be specified.
* `description` - (Optional) Description of what your Lambda Layer does.
* `filename` (Optional) Path to the function's deployment package within the local filesystem. If defined, The `s3`-prefixed options cannot be used.
* `licenseInfo` - (Optional) License info for your Lambda Layer. See [License Info][3].
* `s3Bucket` - (Optional) S3 bucket location containing the function's deployment package. Conflicts with `filename`. This bucket must reside in the same AWS region where you are creating the Lambda function.
* `s3Key` - (Optional) S3 key of an object containing the function's deployment package. Conflicts with `filename`.
* `s3ObjectVersion` - (Optional) Object version containing the function's deployment package. Conflicts with `filename`.
* `skipDestroy` - (Optional) Whether to retain the old version of a previously deployed Lambda Layer. Default is `false`. When this is not set to `true`, changing any of `compatibleArchitectures`, `compatibleRuntimes`, `description`, `filename`, `layerName`, `licenseInfo`, `s3Bucket`, `s3Key`, `s3ObjectVersion`, or `sourceCodeHash` forces deletion of the existing layer version and creation of a new layer version.
* `sourceCodeHash` - (Optional) Used to trigger updates. Must be set to a base64-encoded SHA256 hash of the package file specified with either `filename` or `s3Key`. The usual way to set this is `${filebase64Sha256("fileZip")}` (Terraform 0.11.12 or later) or `${base64Sha256(file("fileZip"))}` (Terraform 0.11.11 and earlier), where "file.zip" is the local filename of the lambda layer source archive.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - ARN of the Lambda Layer with version.
* `createdDate` - Date this resource was created.
* `layerArn` - ARN of the Lambda Layer without version.
* `signingJobArn` - ARN of a signing job.
* `signingProfileVersionArn` - ARN for a signing profile version.
* `sourceCodeSize` - Size in bytes of the function .zip file.
* `version` - Lambda Layer version.
