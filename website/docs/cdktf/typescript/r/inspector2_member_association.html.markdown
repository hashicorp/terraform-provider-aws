```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Inspector2MemberAssociation } from "./.gen/providers/aws/inspector2-member-association";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    Inspector2MemberAssociation.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "123456789012"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Amazon Inspector Member Association using the `accountId`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_inspector2_member_association.example 123456789012
