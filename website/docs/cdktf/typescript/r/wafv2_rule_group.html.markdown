 */
import { Wafv2RuleGroup } from "./.gen/providers/aws/wafv2-rule-group";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new Wafv2RuleGroup(this, "example", {
      capacity: 2,
      name: "example-rule",
      rule: [

* `content` - (Required) The payload of the custom response.
* `contentType` - (Required) The type of content in the payload that you are defining in the `content` argument. Valid values are `TEXT_PLAIN`, `TEXT_HTML`, or `APPLICATION_JSON`.

### Rules

Each `rule` supports the following arguments:

* `action` - (Required) The action that AWS WAF should take on a web request when it matches the rule's statement. Settings at the `aws_wafv2_web_acl` level can override the rule action setting. See [Action](#action) below for details.
* `captchaConfig` - (Optional) Specifies how AWS WAF should handle CAPTCHA evaluations. See [Captcha Configuration](#captcha-configuration) below for details.
* `name` - (Required, Forces new resource) A friendly name of the rule.
* `priority` - (Required) If you define more than one Rule in a WebACL, AWS WAF evaluates each request against the `rules` in order based on the value of `priority`. AWS WAF processes rules with lower priority first.
* `ruleLabel` - (Optional) Labels to apply to web requests that match the rule match statement. See [Rule Label](#rule-label) below for details.
* `statement` - (Required) The AWS WAF processing statement for the rule, for example `byteMatchStatement` or `geoMatchStatement`. See [Statement](#statement) below for details.
* `visibilityConfig` - (Required) Defines and enables Amazon CloudWatch metrics and web request sample collection. See [Visibility Configuration](#visibility-configuration) below for details.

### Action

The `action` block supports the following arguments:

~> **NOTE:** One of `allow`, `block`, or `count`, is required when specifying an `action`.

* `allow` - (Optional) Instructs AWS WAF to allow the web request. See [Allow](#action) below for details.
* `block` - (Optional) Instructs AWS WAF to block the web request. See [Block](#block) below for details.
* `captcha` - (Optional) Instructs AWS WAF to run a `CAPTCHA` check against the web request. See [Captcha](#captcha) below for details.
* `challenge` - (Optional) Instructs AWS WAF to run a check against the request to verify that the request is coming from a legitimate client session. See [Challenge](#challenge) below for details.
* `count` - (Optional) Instructs AWS WAF to count the web request and allow it. See [Count](#count) below for details.

### Allow

The `allow` block supports the following arguments:

* `customRequestHandling` - (Optional) Defines custom handling for the web request. See [Custom Request Handling](#custom-request-handling) below for details.

### Block

The `block` block supports the following arguments:

* `customResponse` - (Optional) Defines a custom response for the web request. See [Custom Response](#custom-response) below for details.

### Captcha

The `captcha` block supports the following arguments:

* `customRequestHandling` - (Optional) Defines custom handling for the web request. See [Custom Request Handling](#custom-request-handling) below for details.

#### Challenge

The `challenge` block supports the following arguments:

* `customRequestHandling` - (Optional) Defines custom handling for the web request. See [Custom Request Handling](#custom-request-handling) below for details.

### Count

The `count` block supports the following arguments:

* `customRequestHandling` - (Optional) Defines custom handling for the web request. See [Custom Request Handling](#custom-request-handling) below for details.

### Custom Request Handling

The `customRequestHandling` block supports the following arguments:

* `insertHeader` - (Required) The `insertHeader` blocks used to define HTTP headers added to the request. See [Custom HTTP Header](#custom-http-header) below for details.

### Custom Response

The `customResponse` block supports the following arguments:

* `customResponseBodyKey` - (Optional) References the response body that you want AWS WAF to return to the web request client. This must reference a `key` defined in a `customResponseBody` block of this resource.
* `responseCode` - (Required) The HTTP status code to return to the client.
* `responseHeader` - (Optional) The `responseHeader` blocks used to define the HTTP response headers added to the response. See [Custom HTTP Header](#custom-http-header) below for details.

### Custom HTTP Header

Each block supports the following arguments. Duplicate header names are not allowed:

* `name` - The name of the custom header. For custom request header insertion, when AWS WAF inserts the header into the request, it prefixes this name `x-amzn-waf-`, to avoid confusion with the headers that are already in the request. For example, for the header name `sample`, AWS WAF inserts the header `x-amzn-waf-sample`.
* `value` - The value of the custom header.

### Rule Label

Each block supports the following arguments:

* `name` - The label string.

### Statement

The processing guidance for a Rule, used by AWS WAF to determine whether a web request matches the rule. See the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statements-list.html) for more information.

-> **NOTE:** Although the `statement` block is recursive, currently only 3 levels are supported.

The `statement` block supports the following arguments:

* `andStatement` - (Optional) A logical rule statement used to combine other rule statements with AND logic. See [AND Statement](#and-statement) below for details.
* `byteMatchStatement` - (Optional) A rule statement that defines a string match search for AWS WAF to apply to web requests. See [Byte Match Statement](#byte-match-statement) below for details.
* `geoMatchStatement` - (Optional) A rule statement used to identify web requests based on country of origin. See [GEO Match Statement](#geo-match-statement) below for details.

* `ipSetReferenceStatement` - (Optional) A rule statement used to detect web requests coming from particular IP addresses or address ranges. See [IP Set Reference Statement](#ip-set-reference-statement) below for details.
* `notStatement` - (Optional) A logical rule statement used to negate the results of another rule statement. See [NOT Statement](#not-statement) below for details.
* `orStatement` - (Optional) A logical rule statement used to combine other rule statements with OR logic. See [OR Statement](#or-statement) below for details.
* `rateBasedStatement` - (Optional) A rate-based rule tracks the rate of requests for each originating `IP address`, and triggers the rule action when the rate exceeds a limit that you specify on the number of requests in any `5-minute` time span. This statement can not be nested. See [Rate Based Statement](#rate-based-statement) below for details.
* `regexMatchStatement` - (Optional) A rule statement used to search web request components for a match against a single regular expression. See [Regex Match Statement](#regex-match-statement) below for details.
