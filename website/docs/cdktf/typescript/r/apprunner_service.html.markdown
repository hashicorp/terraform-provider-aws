## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `encryptionConfiguration` - (Forces new resource) An optional custom encryption key that App Runner uses to encrypt the copy of your source repository that it maintains and your service logs. By default, App Runner uses an AWS managed CMK. See [Encryption Configuration](#encryption-configuration) below for more details.

### Code Configuration

The `codeConfiguration` block supports the following arguments:

* `codeConfigurationValues` - (Optional) Basic configuration for building and running the App Runner service.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import App Runner Services using the `arn`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ApprunnerService } from "./.gen/providers/aws/apprunner-service";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    ApprunnerService.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:1234567890:service/example/0a03292a89764e5882c41d8f991c82fe"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import App Runner Services using the `arn`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_apprunner_service.example arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:1234567890:service/example/0a03292a89764e5882c41d8f991c82fe
```
