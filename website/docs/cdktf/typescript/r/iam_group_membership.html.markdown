# Resource: aws_iam_group_membership

~> **WARNING:** Multiple aws_iam_group_membership resources with the same group name will produce inconsistent behavior!

Provides a top level resource to manage IAM Group membership for IAM Users. For
more information on managing IAM Groups or IAM Users, see [IAM Groups][1] or
[IAM Users][2]

~> **Note:** `aws_iam_group_membership` will conflict with itself if used more than once with the same group. To non-exclusively manage the users in a group, see the
[`aws_iam_user_group_membership` resource][3].

## Example Usage

import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*

 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { IamGroup } from "./.gen/providers/aws/iam-group";
