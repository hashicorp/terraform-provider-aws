# Resource: aws_iam_group_membership

~> **WARNING:** Multiple aws_iam_group_membership resources with the same group name will produce inconsistent behavior!

Provides a top level resource to manage IAM Group membership for IAM Users. For
more information on managing IAM Groups or IAM Users, see [IAM Groups][1] or
[IAM Users][2]

~> **Note:** `awsIamGroupMembership` will conflict with itself if used more than once with the same group. To non-exclusively manage the users in a group, see the
[`awsIamUserGroupMembership` resource][3].

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { IamGroup } from "./.gen/providers/aws/iam-group";
import { IamGroupMembership } from "./.gen/providers/aws/iam-group-membership";
import { IamUser } from "./.gen/providers/aws/iam-user";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const group = new IamGroup(this, "group", {
      name: "test-group",
    });
    const userOne = new IamUser(this, "user_one", {

      group: group.name,
      name: "tf-testing-group-membership",
      users: [userOne.name, userTwo.name],
    });
