# Resource: aws_security_group_rule

Provides a security group rule resource. Represents a single `ingress` or
`egress` group rule, which can be added to external Security Groups.

~> **NOTE on Security Groups and Security Group Rules:** Terraform currently provides a [Security Group resource](security_group.html) with `ingress` and `egress` rules defined in-line and a Security Group Rule resource which manages one or more `ingress` or
`egress` rules. Both of these resource were added before AWS assigned a [security group rule unique ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-rules.html), and they do not work well in all scenarios using the`description` and `tags` attributes, which rely on the unique ID.
The [`aws_vpc_security_group_egress_rule`](vpc_security_group_egress_rule.html) and [`aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule`](vpc_security_group_ingress_rule.html) resources have been added to address these limitations and should be used for all new security group rules.
You should not use the `aws_vpc_security_group_egress_rule` and `aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule` resources in conjunction with an `aws_security_group` resource with in-line rules or with `aws_security_group_rule` resources defined for the same Security Group, as rule conflicts may occur and rules will be overwritten.

~> **NOTE:** Setting `protocol = "all"` or `protocol = -1` with `fromPort` and `toPort` will result in the EC2 API creating a security group rule with all ports open. This API behavior cannot be controlled by Terraform and may generate warnings in the future.

~> **NOTE:** Referencing Security Groups across VPC peering has certain restrictions. More information is available in the [VPC Peering User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/vpc-peering-security-groups.html).

## Example Usage

Basic usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { SecurityGroupRule } from "./.gen/providers/aws/security-group-rule";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new SecurityGroupRule(this, "example", {
      cidrBlocks: [Token.asString(awsVpcExample.cidrBlock)],
      fromPort: 0,
      ipv6CidrBlocks: [Token.asString(awsVpcExample.ipv6CidrBlock)],
      protocol: "tcp",
      securityGroupId: "sg-123456",
      toPort: 65535,
      type: "ingress",
    });
  }
}

```

### Usage With Prefix List IDs

Prefix Lists are either managed by AWS internally, or created by the customer using a
[Managed Prefix List resource](ec2_managed_prefix_list.html). Prefix Lists provided by
AWS are associated with a prefix list name, or service name, that is linked to a specific region.

Prefix list IDs are exported on VPC Endpoints, so you can use this format:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { SecurityGroupRule } from "./.gen/providers/aws/security-group-rule";
import { VpcEndpoint } from "./.gen/providers/aws/vpc-endpoint";
interface MyConfig {
  serviceName: any;
  vpcId: any;
}
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string, config: MyConfig) {
    super(scope, name);
    const myEndpoint = new VpcEndpoint(this, "my_endpoint", {
      serviceName: config.serviceName,
      vpcId: config.vpcId,
    });
    new SecurityGroupRule(this, "allow_all", {
      fromPort: 0,
      prefixListIds: [myEndpoint.prefixListId],
      protocol: "-1",
      securityGroupId: "sg-123456",
      toPort: 0,
      type: "egress",
    });
  }
}

```

You can also find a specific Prefix List using the [`aws_prefix_list`](/docs/providers/aws/d/prefix_list.html)
or [`ec2_managed_prefix_list`](/docs/providers/aws/d/ec2_managed_prefix_list.html) data sources:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsPrefixList } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-prefix-list";
import { DataAwsRegion } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-region";
import { SecurityGroupRule } from "./.gen/providers/aws/security-group-rule";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const current = new DataAwsRegion(this, "current", {});
    const s3 = new DataAwsPrefixList(this, "s3", {
      name: "com.amazonaws.${" + current.name + "}.s3",
    });
    new SecurityGroupRule(this, "s3_gateway_egress", {
      description: "S3 Gateway Egress",
      fromPort: 443,
      prefixListIds: [Token.asString(s3.id)],
      protocol: "tcp",
      securityGroupId: "sg-123456",
      toPort: 443,
      type: "egress",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `fromPort` - (Required) Start port (or ICMP type number if protocol is "icmp" or "icmpv6").
* `protocol` - (Required) Protocol. If not icmp, icmpv6, tcp, udp, or all use the [protocol number](https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml)
* `securityGroupId` - (Required) Security group to apply this rule to.
* `toPort` - (Required) End port (or ICMP code if protocol is "icmp").
* `type` - (Required) Type of rule being created. Valid options are `ingress` (inbound)
or `egress` (outbound).

The following arguments are optional:

~> **Note** Although `cidrBlocks`, `ipv6CidrBlocks`, `prefixListIds`, and `sourceSecurityGroupId` are all marked as optional, you _must_ provide one of them in order to configure the source of the traffic.

* `cidrBlocks` - (Optional) List of CIDR blocks. Cannot be specified with `sourceSecurityGroupId` or `self`.
* `description` - (Optional) Description of the rule.
* `ipv6CidrBlocks` - (Optional) List of IPv6 CIDR blocks. Cannot be specified with `sourceSecurityGroupId` or `self`.
* `prefixListIds` - (Optional) List of Prefix List IDs.
* `self` - (Optional) Whether the security group itself will be added as a source to this ingress rule. Cannot be specified with `cidrBlocks`, `ipv6CidrBlocks`, or `sourceSecurityGroupId`.
* `sourceSecurityGroupId` - (Optional) Security group id to allow access to/from, depending on the `type`. Cannot be specified with `cidrBlocks`, `ipv6CidrBlocks`, or `self`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - ID of the security group rule.
* `securityGroupRuleId` - If the `aws_security_group_rule` resource has a single source or destination then this is the AWS Security Group Rule resource ID. Otherwise it is empty.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

- `create` - (Default `5m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Security Group Rules using the `securityGroupId`, `type`, `protocol`, `fromPort`, `toPort`, and source(s)/destination(s) (such as a `cidrBlock`) separated by underscores (`_`). All parts are required. For example:

**NOTE:** Not all rule permissions (e.g., not all of a rule's CIDR blocks) need to be imported for Terraform to manage rule permissions. However, importing some of a rule's permissions but not others, and then making changes to the rule will result in the creation of an additional rule to capture the updated permissions. Rule permissions that were not imported are left intact in the original rule.

Import an ingress rule in security group `sg-6e616f6d69` for TCP port 8000 with an IPv4 destination CIDR of `10.0.3.0/24`:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { SecurityGroupRule } from "./.gen/providers/aws/security-group-rule";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    SecurityGroupRule.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "ingress",
      "sg-6e616f6d69_ingress_tcp_8000_8000_10.0.3.0/24"
    );
  }
}

```

Import a rule with various IPv4 and IPv6 source CIDR blocks:
