Provides a Security Hub member resource.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { SecurityhubAccount } from "./.gen/providers/aws/securityhub-account";
import { SecurityhubMember } from "./.gen/providers/aws/securityhub-member";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new SecurityhubAccount(this, "example", {});
    const awsSecurityhubMemberExample = new SecurityhubMember(
      this,
      "example_1",
      {
        accountId: "123456789012",
        dependsOn: [example],
        email: "example@example.com",
        invite: true,
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsSecurityhubMemberExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `accountId` - (Required) The ID of the member AWS account.
* `email` - (Optional) The email of the member AWS account.
* `invite` - (Optional) Boolean whether to invite the account to Security Hub as a member. Defaults to `false`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The ID of the member AWS account (matches `accountId`).
* `masterId` - The ID of the master Security Hub AWS account.
* `memberStatus` - The status of the member account relationship.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Security Hub members using their account ID. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { SecurityhubMember } from "./.gen/providers/aws/securityhub-member";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    SecurityhubMember.generateConfigForImport(this, "example", "123456789012");
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Security Hub members using their account ID. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_securityhub_member.example 123456789012
```
