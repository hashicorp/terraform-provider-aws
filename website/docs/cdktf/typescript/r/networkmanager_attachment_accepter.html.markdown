# Resource: aws_networkmanager_attachment_accepter

Manages an AWS Network Manager Attachment Accepter.

Use this resource to accept cross-account attachments in AWS Network Manager. When an attachment is created in one account and needs to be accepted by another account that owns the core network, this resource handles the acceptance process.

## Example Usage

### VPC Attachment

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { NetworkmanagerAttachmentAccepter } from "./.gen/providers/aws/networkmanager-attachment-accepter";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new NetworkmanagerAttachmentAccepter(this, "example", {
      attachmentId: Token.asString(awsNetworkmanagerVpcAttachmentExample.id),
      attachmentType: Token.asString(
        awsNetworkmanagerVpcAttachmentExample.attachmentType
      ),
    });
  }
}

```

### Site-to-Site VPN Attachment

import { NetworkmanagerAttachmentAccepter } from "./.gen/providers/aws/networkmanager-attachment-accepter";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new NetworkmanagerAttachmentAccepter(this, "example", {
      attachmentId: Token.asString(
        awsNetworkmanagerSiteToSiteVpnAttachmentExample.id
      ),
      attachmentType: Token.asString(
