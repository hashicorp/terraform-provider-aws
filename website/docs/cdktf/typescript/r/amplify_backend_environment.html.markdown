# Resource: aws_amplify_backend_environment

Provides an Amplify Backend Environment resource.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { AmplifyApp } from "./.gen/providers/aws/amplify-app";
import { AmplifyBackendEnvironment } from "./.gen/providers/aws/amplify-backend-environment";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new AmplifyApp(this, "example", {
      name: "example",
    });
    const awsAmplifyBackendEnvironmentExample = new AmplifyBackendEnvironment(
      this,
      "example_1",
      {
        appId: example.id,
        deploymentArtifacts: "app-example-deployment",
        environmentName: "example",
        stackName: "amplify-app-example",
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsAmplifyBackendEnvironmentExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `appId` - (Required) Unique ID for an Amplify app.
* `environmentName` - (Required) Name for the backend environment.
* `deploymentArtifacts` - (Optional) Name of deployment artifacts.
* `stackName` - (Optional) AWS CloudFormation stack name of a backend environment.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - ARN for a backend environment that is part of an Amplify app.
* `id` - Unique ID of the Amplify backend environment.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Amplify backend environment using `appId` and `environmentName`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { AmplifyBackendEnvironment } from "./.gen/providers/aws/amplify-backend-environment";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    AmplifyBackendEnvironment.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "d2ypk4k47z8u6/example"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Amplify backend environment using `appId` and `environmentName`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_amplify_backend_environment.example d2ypk4k47z8u6/example
```
