# Resource: aws_lightsail_database

Manages a Lightsail database. Use this resource to create and manage fully managed database instances with automated backups, monitoring, and maintenance in Lightsail.

~> **Note:** Lightsail is currently only supported in a limited number of AWS Regions, please see ["Regions and Availability Zones"](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/) for more details

## Example Usage

### Basic MySQL Blueprint

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LightsailDatabase } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-database";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new LightsailDatabase(this, "example", {
      availabilityZone: "us-east-1a",
      blueprintId: "mysql_8_0",
      bundleId: "micro_1_0",
      masterDatabaseName: "exampledb",
      masterPassword: "examplepassword123",
      masterUsername: "exampleuser",
      relationalDatabaseName: "example-database",
    });
  }
}

```

### Basic PostgreSQL Blueprint

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LightsailDatabase } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-database";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new LightsailDatabase(this, "example", {
      availabilityZone: "us-east-1a",
      blueprintId: "postgres_12",
      bundleId: "micro_1_0",
      masterDatabaseName: "exampledb",
      masterPassword: "examplepassword123",
      masterUsername: "exampleuser",
      relationalDatabaseName: "example-database",
    });
  }
}

```

### Custom Backup and Maintenance Windows

Below is an example that sets a custom backup and maintenance window. Times are specified in UTC. This example will allow daily backups to take place between 16:00 and 16:30 each day. This example also requires any maintenance tasks (anything that would cause an outage, including changing some attributes) to take place on Tuesdays between 17:00 and 17:30. An action taken against this database that would cause an outage will wait until this time window to make the requested changes.

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LightsailDatabase } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-database";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new LightsailDatabase(this, "example", {
      availabilityZone: "us-east-1a",
      blueprintId: "postgres_12",
      bundleId: "micro_1_0",
      masterDatabaseName: "exampledb",
      masterPassword: "examplepassword123",
      masterUsername: "exampleuser",
      preferredBackupWindow: "16:00-16:30",
      preferredMaintenanceWindow: "Tue:17:00-Tue:17:30",
      relationalDatabaseName: "example-database",
    });
  }
}

```

### Final Snapshots

To enable creating a final snapshot of your database on deletion, use the `finalSnapshotName` argument to provide a name to be used for the snapshot.

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LightsailDatabase } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-database";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new LightsailDatabase(this, "example", {
      availabilityZone: "us-east-1a",
      blueprintId: "postgres_12",
      bundleId: "micro_1_0",
      finalSnapshotName: "example-final-snapshot",
      masterDatabaseName: "exampledb",
      masterPassword: "examplepassword123",
      masterUsername: "exampleuser",
      preferredBackupWindow: "16:00-16:30",
      preferredMaintenanceWindow: "Tue:17:00-Tue:17:30",
      relationalDatabaseName: "example-database",
    });
  }
}

```

### Apply Immediately

To enable applying changes immediately instead of waiting for a maintenance window, use the `applyImmediately` argument.

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LightsailDatabase } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-database";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new LightsailDatabase(this, "example", {
      applyImmediately: true,
      availabilityZone: "us-east-1a",
      blueprintId: "postgres_12",
      bundleId: "micro_1_0",
      masterDatabaseName: "exampledb",
      masterPassword: "examplepassword123",
      masterUsername: "exampleuser",
      relationalDatabaseName: "example-database",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `blueprintId` - (Required) Blueprint ID for your database. A blueprint describes the major engine version of a database. You can get a list of database blueprints IDs by using the AWS CLI command: `aws lightsail get-relational-database-blueprints`
* `bundleId` - (Required) Bundle ID for your database. A bundle describes the performance specifications for your database (see list below). You can get a list of database bundle IDs by using the AWS CLI command: `aws lightsail get-relational-database-bundles`.
* `masterDatabaseName` - (Required) Name of the master database created when the Lightsail database resource is created.
* `masterPassword` - (Required, Sensitive) Password for the master user of your database. The password can include any printable ASCII character except "/", """, or "@".
* `masterUsername` - (Required) Master user name for your database.
* `relationalDatabaseName` - (Required) Name to use for your Lightsail database resource. Names be unique within each AWS Region in your Lightsail account.

The following arguments are optional:

* `applyImmediately` - (Optional) Whether to apply changes immediately. When false, applies changes during the preferred maintenance window. Some changes may cause an outage.
* `availabilityZone` - (Optional) Availability Zone in which to create your database. Use the us-east-2a case-sensitive format.
* `backupRetentionEnabled` - (Optional) Whether to enable automated backup retention for your database. When false, disables automated backup retention for your database. Disabling backup retention deletes all automated database backups. Before disabling this, you may want to create a snapshot of your database.
* `finalSnapshotName` - (Required unless `skip_final_snapshot = true`) Name of the database snapshot created if skip final snapshot is false, which is the default value for that parameter.
* `preferredBackupWindow` - (Optional) Daily time range during which automated backups are created for your database if automated backups are enabled. Must be in the hh24:mi-hh24:mi format. Example: `16:00-16:30`. Specified in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
* `preferredMaintenanceWindow` - (Optional) Weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur on your database. Must be in the ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi format. Specified in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Example: `Tue:17:00-Tue:17:30`
* `publiclyAccessible` - (Optional) Whether the database is accessible to resources outside of your Lightsail account. A value of true specifies a database that is available to resources outside of your Lightsail account. A value of false specifies a database that is available only to your Lightsail resources in the same region as your database.
* `skipFinalSnapshot` - (Optional) Whether a final database snapshot is created before your database is deleted. If true is specified, no database snapshot is created. If false is specified, a database snapshot is created before your database is deleted. You must specify the final relational database snapshot name parameter if the skip final snapshot parameter is false.
* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags to assign to the resource. To create a key-only tag, use an empty string as the value. If configured with a provider `defaultTags` configuration block present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Lightsail Databases using their name. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LightsailDatabase } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-database";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    LightsailDatabase.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
