# Resource: aws_lightsail_database

Provides a Lightsail Database. Amazon Lightsail is a service to provide easy virtual private servers
with custom software already setup. See [What is Amazon Lightsail?](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/getting-started/article/what-is-amazon-lightsail)
for more information.

~> **Note:** Lightsail is currently only supported in a limited number of AWS Regions, please see ["Regions and Availability Zones"](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/) for more details

## Example Usage

### Basic mysql blueprint

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LightsailDatabase } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-database";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new LightsailDatabase(this, "test", {
      availabilityZone: "us-east-1a",
      blueprintId: "mysql_8_0",
      bundleId: "micro_1_0",
      masterDatabaseName: "testdatabasename",
      masterPassword: "testdatabasepassword",
      masterUsername: "test",
      relationalDatabaseName: "test",
    });
  }
}

```

### Basic postrgres blueprint

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LightsailDatabase } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-database";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new LightsailDatabase(this, "test", {
      availabilityZone: "us-east-1a",
      blueprintId: "postgres_12",
      bundleId: "micro_1_0",
      masterDatabaseName: "testdatabasename",
      masterPassword: "testdatabasepassword",
      masterUsername: "test",
      relationalDatabaseName: "test",
    });
  }
}

```

### Custom backup and maintenance windows

Below is an example that sets a custom backup and maintenance window. Times are specified in UTC. This example will allow daily backups to take place between 16:00 and 16:30 each day. This example also requires any maintiance tasks (anything that would cause an outage, including changing some attributes) to take place on Tuesdays between 17:00 and 17:30. An action taken against this database that would cause an outage will wait until this time window to make the requested changes.

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LightsailDatabase } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-database";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new LightsailDatabase(this, "test", {
      availabilityZone: "us-east-1a",
      blueprintId: "postgres_12",
      bundleId: "micro_1_0",
      masterDatabaseName: "testdatabasename",
      masterPassword: "testdatabasepassword",
      masterUsername: "test",
      preferredBackupWindow: "16:00-16:30",
      preferredMaintenanceWindow: "Tue:17:00-Tue:17:30",
      relationalDatabaseName: "test",
    });
  }
}

```

### Final Snapshots

To enable creating a final snapshot of your database on deletion, use the `finalSnapshotName` argument to provide a name to be used for the snapshot.

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LightsailDatabase } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-database";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new LightsailDatabase(this, "test", {
      availabilityZone: "us-east-1a",
      blueprintId: "postgres_12",
      bundleId: "micro_1_0",
      finalSnapshotName: "MyFinalSnapshot",
      masterDatabaseName: "testdatabasename",
      masterPassword: "testdatabasepassword",
      masterUsername: "test",
      preferredBackupWindow: "16:00-16:30",
      preferredMaintenanceWindow: "Tue:17:00-Tue:17:30",
      relationalDatabaseName: "test",
    });
  }
}

```

### Apply Immediately

To enable applying changes immediately instead of waiting for a maintiance window, use the `applyImmediately` argument.

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LightsailDatabase } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-database";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new LightsailDatabase(this, "test", {
      applyImmediately: true,
      availabilityZone: "us-east-1a",
      blueprintId: "postgres_12",
      bundleId: "micro_1_0",
      masterDatabaseName: "testdatabasename",
      masterPassword: "testdatabasepassword",
      masterUsername: "test",
      relationalDatabaseName: "test",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `relationalDatabaseName` - (Required) The name to use for your new Lightsail database resource. Names be unique within each AWS Region in your Lightsail account.
* `availabilityZone` - The Availability Zone in which to create your new database. Use the us-east-2a case-sensitive format.
* `masterDatabaseName` - (Required) The name of the master database created when the Lightsail database resource is created.
* `masterPassword` - (Sensitive) The password for the master user of your new database. The password can include any printable ASCII character except "/", """, or "@".
* `masterUsername` - The master user name for your new database.
* `blueprintId` - (Required) The blueprint ID for your new database. A blueprint describes the major engine version of a database. You can get a list of database blueprints IDs by using the AWS CLI command: `aws lightsail get-relational-database-blueprints`
* `bundleId` - (Required)  The bundle ID for your new database. A bundle describes the performance specifications for your database (see list below). You can get a list of database bundle IDs by using the AWS CLI command: `aws lightsail get-relational-database-bundles`.
* `preferredBackupWindow` - The daily time range during which automated backups are created for your new database if automated backups are enabled. Must be in the hh24:mi-hh24:mi format. Example: `16:00-16:30`. Specified in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
* `preferredMaintenanceWindow` - The weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur on your new database. Must be in the ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi format. Specified in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Example: `Tue:17:00-Tue:17:30`
* `publiclyAccessible` - Specifies the accessibility options for your new database. A value of true specifies a database that is available to resources outside of your Lightsail account. A value of false specifies a database that is available only to your Lightsail resources in the same region as your database.
* `applyImmediately` - When true , applies changes immediately. When false , applies changes during the preferred maintenance window. Some changes may cause an outage.
* `backupRetentionEnabled` - When true, enables automated backup retention for your database. When false, disables automated backup retention for your database. Disabling backup retention deletes all automated database backups. Before disabling this, you may want to create a snapshot of your database.
* `skipFinalSnapshot` - Determines whether a final database snapshot is created before your database is deleted. If true is specified, no database snapshot is created. If false is specified, a database snapshot is created before your database is deleted. You must specify the final relational database snapshot name parameter if the skip final snapshot parameter is false.
* `finalSnapshotName` - (Required unless `skip_final_snapshot = true`) The name of the database snapshot created if skip final snapshot is false, which is the default value for that parameter.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. To create a key-only tag, use an empty string as the value.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Lightsail Databases using their name. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LightsailDatabase } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-database";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    LightsailDatabase.generateConfigForImport(this, "foo", "bar");
  }
}

```
