Terraform resource for managing an AWS SSM Contacts Contact Channel.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { SsmcontactsContactChannel } from "./.gen/providers/aws/ssmcontacts-contact-channel";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new SsmcontactsContactChannel(this, "example", {
      contactId:
        "arn:aws:ssm-contacts:us-west-2:123456789012:contact/contactalias",
      deliveryAddress: {
        simpleAddress: "email@example.com",

  }
}

```

### Usage with SSM Contact

```typescript

import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { SsmcontactsContact } from "./.gen/providers/aws/ssmcontacts-contact";
import { SsmcontactsContactChannel } from "./.gen/providers/aws/ssmcontacts-contact-channel";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const exampleContact = new SsmcontactsContact(this, "example_contact", {
      alias: "example_contact",
      type: "PERSONAL",
    });
    new SsmcontactsContactChannel(this, "example", {
      contactId: exampleContact.arn,
      deliveryAddress: {
        simpleAddress: "email@example.com",
      },
      name: "Example contact channel",
      type: "EMAIL",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

~> **NOTE:** The contact channel needs to be activated in the AWS Systems Manager console, otherwise it can't be used to engage the contact. See the [Contacts section of the Incident Manager User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/incident-manager/latest/userguide/contacts.html) for more information.

The following arguments are required:

- `contactId` - (Required) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS SSM Contact that the contact channel belongs to.

- `deliveryAddress` - (Required) Block that contains contact engagement details. See details below.

- `name` - (Required) Name of the contact channel. Must be between 1 and 255 characters, and may contain alphanumerics, underscores (`_`), hyphens (`-`), periods (`.`), and spaces.

- `type` - (Required) Type of the contact channel. One of `SMS`, `VOICE` or `EMAIL`.

### delivery_address

- `simpleAddress` - (Required) Details to engage this contact channel. The expected format depends on the contact channel type and is described in the [`ContactChannelAddress` section of the SSM Contacts API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/incident-manager/latest/APIReference/API_SSMContacts_ContactChannelAddress.html).

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

- `activationStatus` - Whether the contact channel is activated. The contact channel must be activated to use it to engage the contact. One of `ACTIVATED` or `NOT_ACTIVATED`.

- `arn` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the contact channel.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import SSM Contact Channel using the `ARN`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { SsmcontactsContactChannel } from "./.gen/providers/aws/ssmcontacts-contact-channel";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    SsmcontactsContactChannel.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "arn:aws:ssm-contacts:us-west-2:123456789012:contact-channel/example"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import SSM Contact Channel using the `ARN`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_ssmcontacts_contact_channel.example arn:aws:ssm-contacts:us-west-2:123456789012:contact-channel/example
```
