Provides a SageMaker data quality job definition resource.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `name` - The name of the data quality job definition.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import data quality job definitions using the `name`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { SagemakerDataQualityJobDefinition } from "./.gen/providers/aws/sagemaker-data-quality-job-definition";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    SagemakerDataQualityJobDefinition.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "testDataQualityJobDefinition",
      "data-quality-job-definition-foo"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import data quality job definitions using the `name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_sagemaker_data_quality_job_definition.test_data_quality_job_definition data-quality-job-definition-foo
```
