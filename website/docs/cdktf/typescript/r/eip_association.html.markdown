# Resource: aws_eip_association

Provides an AWS EIP Association as a top level resource, to associate and
disassociate Elastic IPs from AWS Instances and Network Interfaces.

~> **NOTE:** Do not use this resource to associate an EIP to `aws_lb` or `aws_nat_gateway` resources. Instead use the `allocationId` available in those resources to allow AWS to manage the association, otherwise you will see `AuthFailure` errors.

~> **NOTE:** `aws_eip_association` is useful in scenarios where EIPs are either
pre-existing or distributed to customers or users and therefore cannot be changed.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Eip } from "./.gen/providers/aws/eip";
import { EipAssociation } from "./.gen/providers/aws/eip-association";
import { Instance } from "./.gen/providers/aws/instance";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new Eip(this, "example", {
      domain: "vpc",
    });
    const web = new Instance(this, "web", {
      ami: "ami-21f78e11",
      availabilityZone: "us-west-2a",
      instanceType: "t2.micro",
      tags: {
        Name: "HelloWorld",
      },
    });
    new EipAssociation(this, "eip_assoc", {
      allocationId: example.id,
      instanceId: web.id,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `allocationId` - (Optional) The allocation ID. This is required for EC2-VPC.
* `allowReassociation` - (Optional, Boolean) Whether to allow an Elastic IP to
be re-associated. Defaults to `true` in VPC.
* `instanceId` - (Optional) The ID of the instance. This is required for
EC2-Classic. For EC2-VPC, you can specify either the instance ID or the
network interface ID, but not both. The operation fails if you specify an
instance ID unless exactly one network interface is attached.
* `networkInterfaceId` - (Optional) The ID of the network interface. If the
instance has more than one network interface, you must specify a network
interface ID.
* `privateIpAddress` - (Optional) The primary or secondary private IP address
to associate with the Elastic IP address. If no private IP address is
specified, the Elastic IP address is associated with the primary private IP
address.
* `publicIp` - (Optional) The Elastic IP address. This is required for EC2-Classic.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `associationId` - The ID that represents the association of the Elastic IP
address with an instance.
* `allocationId` - As above
* `instanceId` - As above
* `networkInterfaceId` - As above
* `privateIpAddress` - As above
* `publicIp` - As above

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import EIP Assocations using their association IDs. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { EipAssociation } from "./.gen/providers/aws/eip-association";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    EipAssociation.generateConfigForImport(this, "test", "eipassoc-ab12c345");
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import EIP Assocations using their association IDs. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_eip_association.test eipassoc-ab12c345
```
