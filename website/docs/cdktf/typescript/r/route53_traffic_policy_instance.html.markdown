 */
import { Route53TrafficPolicyInstance } from "./.gen/providers/aws/route53-traffic-policy-instance";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new Route53TrafficPolicyInstance(this, "test", {
      hostedZoneId: "Z033120931TAQO548OGJC",
      name: "test.example.com",
      trafficPolicyId: "b3gb108f-ea6f-45a5-baab-9d112d8b4037",

The following arguments are required:

* `name` - (Required) Domain name for which Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries by using the resource record sets that Route 53 creates for this traffic policy instance.
* `trafficPolicyId` - (Required) ID of the traffic policy that you want to use to create resource record sets in the specified hosted zone.
* `trafficPolicyVersion` - (Required) Version of the traffic policy
* `hostedZoneId` - (Required) ID of the hosted zone that you want Amazon Route 53 to create resource record sets in by using the configuration in a traffic policy.

## Attribute Reference

* `id` - ID of traffic policy instance.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Route53 traffic policy instance using its id. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Route53TrafficPolicyInstance } from "./.gen/providers/aws/route53-traffic-policy-instance";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    Route53TrafficPolicyInstance.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "test",
      "df579d9a-6396-410e-ac22-e7ad60cf9e7e"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Route53 traffic policy instance using its id. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_route53_traffic_policy_instance.test df579d9a-6396-410e-ac22-e7ad60cf9e7e
```
