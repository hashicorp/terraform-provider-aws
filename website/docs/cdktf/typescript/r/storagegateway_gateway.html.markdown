# Resource: aws_storagegateway_gateway

Manages an AWS Storage Gateway file, tape, or volume gateway in the provider region.

~> **NOTE:** The Storage Gateway API requires the gateway to be connected to properly return information after activation. If you are receiving `The specified gateway is not connected` errors during resource creation (gateway activation), ensure your gateway instance meets the [Storage Gateway requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/Requirements.html).

## Example Usage

### Local Cache

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsStoragegatewayLocalDisk } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-storagegateway-local-disk";
import { StoragegatewayCache } from "./.gen/providers/aws/storagegateway-cache";
import { VolumeAttachment } from "./.gen/providers/aws/volume-attachment";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new VolumeAttachment(this, "test", {
      deviceName: "/dev/xvdb",
      instanceId: Token.asString(awsInstanceTest.id),
      volumeId: Token.asString(awsEbsVolumeTest.id),
    });
    const dataAwsStoragegatewayLocalDiskTest =
      new DataAwsStoragegatewayLocalDisk(this, "test_1", {
        diskNode: Token.asString(dataAwsVolumeAttachmentTest.deviceName),
        gatewayArn: Token.asString(awsStoragegatewayGatewayTest.arn),
      });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    dataAwsStoragegatewayLocalDiskTest.overrideLogicalId("test");
    const awsStoragegatewayCacheTest = new StoragegatewayCache(this, "test_2", {
      diskId: Token.asString(dataAwsStoragegatewayLocalDiskTest.diskId),
      gatewayArn: Token.asString(awsStoragegatewayGatewayTest.arn),
    });

## Argument Reference

~> **NOTE:** One of `activationKey` or `gatewayIpAddress` must be provided for resource creation (gateway activation). Neither is required for resource import. If using `gatewayIpAddress`, Terraform must be able to make an HTTP (port 80) GET request to the specified IP address from where it is running.

This argument supports the following arguments:

* `gatewayName` - (Required) Name of the gateway.
* `gatewayTimezone` - (Required) Time zone for the gateway. The time zone is of the format "GMT", "GMT-hr:mm", or "GMT+hr:mm". For example, `GMT-4:00` indicates the time is 4 hours behind GMT. The time zone is used, for example, for scheduling snapshots and your gateway's maintenance schedule.
* `activationKey` - (Optional) Gateway activation key during resource creation. Conflicts with `gateway_ip_address`. Additional information is available in the [Storage Gateway User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/get-activation-key.html).
* `averageDownloadRateLimitInBitsPerSec` - (Optional) The average download bandwidth rate limit in bits per second. This is supported for the `CACHED`, `STORED`, and `VTL` gateway types.
* `averageUploadRateLimitInBitsPerSec` - (Optional) The average upload bandwidth rate limit in bits per second. This is supported for the `CACHED`, `STORED`, and `VTL` gateway types.
* `gatewayIpAddress` - (Optional) Gateway IP address to retrieve activation key during resource creation. Conflicts with `activation_key`. Gateway must be accessible on port 80 from where Terraform is running. Additional information is available in the [Storage Gateway User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/get-activation-key.html).
* `gatewayType` - (Optional) Type of the gateway. The default value is `STORED`. Valid values: `CACHED`, `FILE_FSX_SMB`, `FILE_S3`, `STORED`, `VTL`.
* `gatewayVpcEndpoint` - (Optional) VPC endpoint address to be used when activating your gateway. This should be used when your instance is in a private subnet. Requires HTTP access from client computer running terraform. More info on what ports are required by your VPC Endpoint Security group in [Activating a Gateway in a Virtual Private Cloud](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/gateway-private-link.html).
* `cloudwatchLogGroupArn` - (Optional) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon CloudWatch log group to use to monitor and log events in the gateway.
* `maintenanceStartTime` - (Optional) The gateway's weekly maintenance start time information, including day and time of the week. The maintenance time is the time in your gateway's time zone. More details below.
* `mediumChangerType` - (Optional) Type of medium changer to use for tape gateway. Terraform cannot detect drift of this argument. Valid values: `STK-L700`, `AWS-Gateway-VTL`, `IBM-03584L32-0402`.
* `smbActiveDirectorySettings` - (Optional) Nested argument with Active Directory domain join information for Server Message Block (SMB) file shares. Only valid for `FILE_S3` and `FILE_FSX_SMB` gateway types. Must be set before creating `ActiveDirectory` authentication SMB file shares. More details below.
* `smbGuestPassword` - (Optional) Guest password for Server Message Block (SMB) file shares. Only valid for `FILE_S3` and `FILE_FSX_SMB` gateway types. Must be set before creating `GuestAccess` authentication SMB file shares. Terraform can only detect drift of the existence of a guest password, not its actual value from the gateway. Terraform can however update the password with changing the argument.
* `smbSecurityStrategy` - (Optional) Specifies the type of security strategy. Valid values are: `ClientSpecified`, `MandatorySigning`, and `MandatoryEncryption`. See [Setting a Security Level for Your Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/managing-gateway-file.html#security-strategy) for more information.
* `smbFileShareVisibility` - (Optional) Specifies whether the shares on this gateway appear when listing shares.
* `tapeDriveType` - (Optional) Type of tape drive to use for tape gateway. Terraform cannot detect drift of this argument. Valid values: `IBM-ULT3580-TD5`.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

### maintenance_start_time

* `dayOfMonth` - (Optional) The day of the month component of the maintenance start time represented as an ordinal number from 1 to 28, where 1 represents the first day of the month and 28 represents the last day of the month.
* `dayOfWeek` - (Optional) The day of the week component of the maintenance start time week represented as an ordinal number from 0 to 6, where 0 represents Sunday and 6 Saturday.
* `hourOfDay` - (Required) The hour component of the maintenance start time represented as _hh_, where _hh_ is the hour (00 to 23). The hour of the day is in the time zone of the gateway.
* `minuteOfHour` - (Required) The minute component of the maintenance start time represented as _mm_, where _mm_ is the minute (00 to 59). The minute of the hour is in the time zone of the gateway.

### smb_active_directory_settings

Information to join the gateway to an Active Directory domain for Server Message Block (SMB) file shares.

~> **NOTE** It is not possible to unconfigure this setting without recreating the gateway. Also, Terraform can only detect drift of the `domainName` argument from the gateway.

~> **NOTE:** The Storage Gateway needs to be able to resolve the name of your Active Directory Domain Controller. If the gateway is hosted on EC2, ensure that DNS/DHCP is configured prior to creating the EC2 instance. If you are receiving `networkError` errors during resource creation (gateway joining the domain), ensure your gateway instance meets the [FSx File Gateway requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/filegateway/latest/filefsxw/Requirements.html).

* `domainName` - (Required) The name of the domain that you want the gateway to join.
* `password` - (Required) The password of the user who has permission to add the gateway to the Active Directory domain.
* `username` - (Required) The user name of user who has permission to add the gateway to the Active Directory domain.
* `timeoutInSeconds` - (Optional) Specifies the time in seconds, in which the JoinDomain operation must complete. The default is `20` seconds.
* `organizationalUnit` - (Optional) The organizational unit (OU) is a container in an Active Directory that can hold users, groups,
 computers, and other OUs and this parameter specifies the OU that the gateway will join within the AD domain.
* `domainControllers` - (Optional) List of IPv4 addresses, NetBIOS names, or host names of your domain server.
 If you need to specify the port number include it after the colon (“:”). For example, `mydc.mydomain.com:389`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway.
* `arn` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway.
* `gatewayId` - Identifier of the gateway.
* `ec2InstanceId` - The ID of the Amazon EC2 instance that was used to launch the gateway.
* `endpointType` - The type of endpoint for your gateway.
* `hostEnvironment` - The type of hypervisor environment used by the host.
* `gatewayNetworkInterface` - An array that contains descriptions of the gateway network interfaces. See [Gateway Network Interface](#gateway-network-interface).
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

### Gateway Network Interface

* `ipv4Address` - The Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) address of the interface.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `create` - (Default `10m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `awsStoragegatewayGateway` using the gateway Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import `awsStoragegatewayGateway` using the gateway Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_storagegateway_gateway.example arn:aws:storagegateway:us-east-1:123456789012:gateway/sgw-12345678
```

Certain resource arguments, like `gatewayIpAddress` do not have a Storage Gateway API method for reading the information after creation, either omit the argument from the Terraform configuration or use [`ignoreChanges`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/meta-arguments/lifecycle.html#ignore_changes) to hide the difference. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { StoragegatewayGateway } from "./.gen/providers/aws/storagegateway-gateway";
interface MyConfig {
  gatewayName: any;
  gatewayTimezone: any;
}
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string, config: MyConfig) {
    super(scope, name);
    new StoragegatewayGateway(this, "example", {
      gatewayIpAddress: sgw.privateIp,
      lifecycle: {
        ignoreChanges: ["gateway_ip_address"],
      },
      gatewayName: config.gatewayName,
      gatewayTimezone: config.gatewayTimezone,
    });
  }
}

```
