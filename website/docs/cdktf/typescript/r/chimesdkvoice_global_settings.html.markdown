```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ChimesdkvoiceGlobalSettings } from "./.gen/providers/aws/chimesdkvoice-global-settings";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    ChimesdkvoiceGlobalSettings.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "123456789012"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import AWS Chime SDK Voice Global Settings using the `id` (AWS account ID). For example:
