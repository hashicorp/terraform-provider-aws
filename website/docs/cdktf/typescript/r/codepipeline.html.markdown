* `type` - (Required) The type of the artifact store, such as Amazon S3
* `encryptionKey` - (Optional) The encryption key block AWS CodePipeline uses to encrypt the data in the artifact store, such as an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key. If you don't specify a key, AWS CodePipeline uses the default key for Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). An `encryptionKey` block is documented below.
* `region` - (Optional) The region where the artifact store is located. Required for a cross-region CodePipeline, do not provide for a single-region CodePipeline.

An `encryptionKey` block supports the following arguments:

* `id` - (Required) The KMS key ARN or ID
* `type` - (Required) The type of key; currently only `KMS` is supported

A `stage` block supports the following arguments:

* `inputArtifacts` - (Optional) A list of artifact names to be worked on.
* `outputArtifacts` - (Optional) A list of artifact names to output. Output artifact names must be unique within a pipeline.
* `roleArn` - (Optional) The ARN of the IAM service role that will perform the declared action. This is assumed through the roleArn for the pipeline.
* `runOrder` - (Optional) The order in which actions are run.
* `region` - (Optional) The region in which to run the action.
* `namespace` - (Optional) The namespace all output variables will be accessed from.

A `trigger` block supports the following arguments:

* `providerType` - (Required) The source provider for the event. Possible value is `CodeStarSourceConnection`.
* `gitConfiguration` - (Required) Provides the filter criteria and the source stage for the repository event that starts the pipeline. For more information, refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/pipelines-filter.html). A `gitConfiguration` block is documented below.

A `gitConfiguration` block supports the following arguments:

* `pullRequest` - (Optional) The field where the repository event that will start the pipeline is specified as pull requests. A `pullRequest` block is documented below.
* `push` - (Optional) The field where the repository event that will start the pipeline, such as pushing Git tags, is specified with details. A `push` block is documented below.

A `pullRequest` block supports the following arguments:

* `events` - (Optional) A list that specifies which pull request events to filter on (opened, updated, closed) for the trigger configuration. Possible values are `OPEN`, `UPDATED ` and `CLOSED`.
* `branches` - (Optional) The field that specifies to filter on branches for the pull request trigger configuration. A `branches` block is documented below.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The codepipeline ID.
* `arn` - The codepipeline ARN.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import CodePipelines using the name. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Codepipeline } from "./.gen/providers/aws/codepipeline";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    Codepipeline.generateConfigForImport(this, "foo", "example");
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import CodePipelines using the name. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_codepipeline.foo example
```
