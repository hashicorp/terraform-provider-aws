## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import SES receipt rules using the ruleset name and rule name separated by `:`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { SesReceiptRule } from "./.gen/providers/aws/ses-receipt-rule";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    SesReceiptRule.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "myRule",
      "my_rule_set:my_rule"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import SES receipt rules using the ruleset name and rule name separated by `:`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_ses_receipt_rule.my_rule my_rule_set:my_rule
```
