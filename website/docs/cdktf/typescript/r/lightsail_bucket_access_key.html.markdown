# Resource: aws_lightsail_bucket_access_key

Provides a lightsail bucket access key. This is a set of credentials that allow API requests to be made to the lightsail bucket.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LightsailBucketAccessKeyAccessKey } from "./.gen/providers/aws/";
import { LightsailBucket } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lightsail-bucket";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new LightsailBucket(this, "test", {
      bundleId: "small_1_0",
      name: "mytestbucket",
    });
    const awsLightsailBucketAccessKeyAccessKeyTest =
      new LightsailBucketAccessKeyAccessKey(this, "test_1", {
        bucket_name: awsLightsailBucketAccessKeyTest.id,
      });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsLightsailBucketAccessKeyAccessKeyTest.overrideLogicalId("test");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `bucketName` - (Required) The name of the bucket that the new access key will belong to, and grant access to.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - A combination of attributes separated by a `,` to create a unique id: `bucket_name`,`access_key_id`
* `accessKeyId` - The ID of the access key.
* `createdAt` - The timestamp when the access key was created.
* `secretAccessKey` - The secret access key used to sign requests. This attribute is not available for imported resources. Note that this will be written to the state file.
* `status` - The status of the access key.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `awsLightsailBucketAccessKey` using the `id` attribute. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import `awsLightsailBucketAccessKey` using the `id` attribute. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_lightsail_bucket_access_key.test example-bucket,AKIA47VOQ2KPR7LLRZ6D
```
