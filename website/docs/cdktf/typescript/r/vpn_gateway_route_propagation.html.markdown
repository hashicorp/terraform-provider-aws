import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";

 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { VpnGatewayRoutePropagation } from "./.gen/providers/aws/vpn-gateway-route-propagation";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new VpnGatewayRoutePropagation(this, "example", {
      routeTableId: Token.asString(awsRouteTableExample.id),
