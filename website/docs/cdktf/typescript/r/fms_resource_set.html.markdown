Terraform resource for managing an AWS FMS (Firewall Manager) Resource Set.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { FmsResourceSet } from "./.gen/providers/aws/fms-resource-set";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new FmsResourceSet(this, "example", {
      resourceSet: [
        {
          name: "testing",
          resourceTypeList: ["AWS::NetworkFirewall::Firewall"],
        },
      ],
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `resourceSet` - (Required) Details about the resource set to be created or updated. See [`resourceSet` Attribute Reference](#resource_set-attribute-reference) below.

### `resourceSet` Attribute Reference

* `name` - (Required) Descriptive name of the resource set. You can't change the name of a resource set after you create it.
* `resourceTypeList` - (Required) Determines the resources that can be associated to the resource set. Depending on your setting for max results and the number of resource sets, a single call might not return the full list.
* `description` - (Optional) Description of the resource set.
* `lastUpdateTime` - (Optional) Last time that the reosurce set was changed.
* `resourceSetStatus` - (Optional) Indicates whether the resource set is in or out of the admin's Region scope. Valid values are `ACTIVE` (Admin can manage and delete the resource set) or `OUT_OF_ADMIN_SCOPE` (Admin can view the resource set, but theyy can't edit or delete the resource set.)

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - ARN of the Resource Set.
* `id` - Unique identifier for the resource set. It's returned in the responses to create and list commands. You provide it to operations like update and delete.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `create` - (Default `30m`)
* `update` - (Default `30m`)
* `delete` - (Default `30m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import FMS (Firewall Manager) Resource Set using the `id`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { FmsResourceSet } from "./.gen/providers/aws/fms-resource-set";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    FmsResourceSet.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "resource_set-id-12345678"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import FMS (Firewall Manager) Resource Set using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_fms_resource_set.example resource_set-id-12345678
```
