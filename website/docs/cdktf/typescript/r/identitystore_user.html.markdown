# Resource: aws_identitystore_user

This resource manages a User resource within an Identity Store.

-> **Note:** If you use an external identity provider or Active Directory as your identity source,
use this resource with caution. IAM Identity Center does not support outbound synchronization,
so your identity source does not automatically update with the changes that you make to
users using this resource.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Fn, Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { IdentitystoreUser } from "./.gen/providers/aws/identitystore-user";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new IdentitystoreUser(this, "example", {
      displayName: "John Doe",
      emails: {
        value: "john@example.com",
      },
      identityStoreId: Token.asString(
        Fn.lookupNested(
          Fn.tolist(dataAwsSsoadminInstancesExample.identityStoreIds),
          ["0"]
        )
      ),
      name: {
        familyName: "Doe",

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import an Identity Store User using the combination `identity_store_id/user_id`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { IdentitystoreUser } from "./.gen/providers/aws/identitystore-user";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    IdentitystoreUser.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "d-9c6705e95c/065212b4-9061-703b-5876-13a517ae2a7c"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import an Identity Store User using the combination `identity_store_id/user_id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_identitystore_user.example d-9c6705e95c/065212b4-9061-703b-5876-13a517ae2a7c
```
