# Resource: aws_ram_sharing_with_organization

Manages Resource Access Manager (RAM) Resource Sharing with AWS Organizations. If you enable sharing with your organization, you can share resources without using invitations. Refer to the [AWS RAM user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/getting-started-sharing.html#getting-started-sharing-orgs) for more details.

~> **NOTE:** Use this resource to manage resource sharing within your organization, **not** the [`aws_organizations_organization`](organizations_organization.html) resource with `ram.amazonaws.com` configured in `awsServiceAccessPrincipals`.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { RamSharingWithOrganization } from "./.gen/providers/aws/ram-sharing-with-organization";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new RamSharingWithOrganization(this, "example", {});
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource does not support any arguments.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - AWS Account ID.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import the resource using the current AWS account ID. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { RamSharingWithOrganization } from "./.gen/providers/aws/ram-sharing-with-organization";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    RamSharingWithOrganization.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "123456789012"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import the resource using the current AWS account ID. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_ram_sharing_with_organization.example 123456789012
```
