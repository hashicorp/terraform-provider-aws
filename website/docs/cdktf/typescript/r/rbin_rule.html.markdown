# Resource: aws_rbin_rule

Terraform resource for managing an AWS RBin Rule.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { RbinRule } from "./.gen/providers/aws/rbin-rule";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new RbinRule(this, "example", {
      description: "Example tag-level retention rule",
      resourceTags: [
        {
          resourceTagKey: "tag_key",
          resourceTagValue: "tag_value",
        },
      ],
      resourceType: "EBS_SNAPSHOT",
      retentionPeriod: {
        retentionPeriodUnit: "DAYS",
        retentionPeriodValue: 10,
      },
      tags: {
        test_tag_key: "test_tag_value",
      },
    });
  }
}

```

### Region-Level Retention Rule

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { RbinRule } from "./.gen/providers/aws/rbin-rule";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new RbinRule(this, "example", {
      description: "Example region-level retention rule with exclusion tags",
      excludeResourceTags: [
        {
          resourceTagKey: "tag_key",
          resourceTagValue: "tag_value",
        },
      ],
      resourceType: "EC2_IMAGE",
      retentionPeriod: {
        retentionPeriodUnit: "DAYS",
        retentionPeriodValue: 10,
      },
      tags: {
        test_tag_key: "test_tag_value",
      },
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `resourceType` - (Required) Resource type to be retained by the retention rule. Valid values are `EBS_SNAPSHOT` and `EC2_IMAGE`.
* `retentionPeriod` - (Required) Information about the retention period for which the retention rule is to retain resources. See [`retentionPeriod`](#retention_period) below.

The following arguments are optional:

* `region` - (Optional) Region where this resource will be [managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints). Defaults to the Region set in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#aws-configuration-reference).
* `description` - (Optional) Retention rule description.
* `excludeResourceTags` - (Optional) Exclusion tags to use to identify resources that are to be excluded, or ignored, by a Region-level retention rule. See [`excludeResourceTags`](#exclude_resource_tags) below.
* `lockConfiguration` - (Optional) Information about the retention rule lock configuration. See [`lockConfiguration`](#lock_configuration) below.
* `resourceTags` - (Optional) Resource tags to use to identify resources that are to be retained by a tag-level retention rule. See [`resourceTags`](#resource_tags) below.

### retention_period

The following arguments are required:

* `retentionPeriodUnit` - (Required) Unit of time in which the retention period is measured. Currently, only DAYS is supported.
* `retentionPeriodValue` - (Required) Period value for which the retention rule is to retain resources. The period is measured using the unit specified for RetentionPeriodUnit.

### exclude_resource_tags

The following argument is required:

* `resourceTagKey` - (Required) Tag key.

The following argument is optional:

* `resourceTagValue` - (Optional) Tag value.

### lock_configuration

The following argument is required:

* `unlockDelay` - (Required) Information about the retention rule unlock delay. See [`unlockDelay`](#unlock_delay) below.

### unlock_delay

The following arguments are required:

* `unlockDelayUnit` - (Required) Unit of time in which to measure the unlock delay. Currently, the unlock delay can be measure only in days.
* `unlockDelayValue` - (Required) Unlock delay period, measured in the unit specified for UnlockDelayUnit.

### resource_tags

The following argument is required:

* `resourceTagKey` - (Required) Tag key.

The following argument is optional:

* `resourceTagValue` - (Optional) Tag value.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - (String) ID of the Rule.
* `lockEndTime` - (Timestamp) Date and time at which the unlock delay is set to expire. Only returned for retention rules that have been unlocked and that are still within the unlock delay period.
* `lockState` - (Optional) Lock state of the retention rules to list. Only retention rules with the specified lock state are returned. Valid values are `locked`, `pending_unlock`, `unlocked`.
* `status` - (String) State of the retention rule. Only retention rules that are in the `available` state retain resources. Valid values include `pending` and `available`.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import RBin Rule using the `id`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { RbinRule } from "./.gen/providers/aws/rbin-rule";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    RbinRule.generateConfigForImport(this, "example", "examplerule");
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import RBin Rule using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_rbin_rule.example examplerule
```
