import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.

 */
import { BackupVaultLockConfiguration } from "./.gen/providers/aws/backup-vault-lock-configuration";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {

    super(scope, name);
    new BackupVaultLockConfiguration(this, "test", {
      backupVaultName: "example_backup_vault",
      changeableForDays: 3,
      maxRetentionDays: 1200,

* `backupVaultName` - The name of the vault.
* `backupVaultArn` - The ARN of the vault.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Backup vault lock configuration using the `name`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { BackupVaultLockConfiguration } from "./.gen/providers/aws/backup-vault-lock-configuration";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    BackupVaultLockConfiguration.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "test",
      "TestVault"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Backup vault lock configuration using the `name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_backup_vault_lock_configuration.test TestVault
```
