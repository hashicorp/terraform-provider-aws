# Resource: aws_backup_vault

Provides an AWS Backup vault resource.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { BackupVault } from "./.gen/providers/aws/backup-vault";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new BackupVault(this, "example", {
      kmsKeyArn: Token.asString(awsKmsKeyExample.arn),
      name: "example_backup_vault",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `forceDestroy` - (Optional, Default: `false`) A boolean that indicates that all recovery points stored in the vault are deleted so that the vault can be destroyed without error.
* `kmsKeyArn` - (Optional) The server-side encryption key that is used to protect your backups.
* `name` - (Required) Name of the backup vault to create.
* `tags` - (Optional) Metadata that you can assign to help organize the resources that you create. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The name of the vault.
* `arn` - The ARN of the vault.
* `recoveryPoints` - The number of recovery points that are stored in a backup vault.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

- `delete` - (Default `10m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Backup vault using the `name`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { BackupVault } from "./.gen/providers/aws/backup-vault";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    BackupVault.generateConfigForImport(this, "testVault", "TestVault");
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Backup vault using the `name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_backup_vault.test-vault TestVault
```
