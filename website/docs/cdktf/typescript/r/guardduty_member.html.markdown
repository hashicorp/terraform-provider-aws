# Resource: aws_guardduty_member

Provides a resource to manage a GuardDuty member. To accept invitations in member accounts, see the [`aws_guardduty_invite_accepter` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/guardduty_invite_accepter.html).

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { GuarddutyDetector } from "./.gen/providers/aws/guardduty-detector";
import { GuarddutyMember } from "./.gen/providers/aws/guardduty-member";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const member = new GuarddutyDetector(this, "member", {
      enable: true,
      provider: dev,
    });
    const primary = new GuarddutyDetector(this, "primary", {
      enable: true,
    });
    const awsGuarddutyMemberMember = new GuarddutyMember(this, "member_2", {
      accountId: member.accountId,
      detectorId: primary.id,
      email: "required@example.com",
      invitationMessage: "please accept guardduty invitation",
      invite: true,
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsGuarddutyMemberMember.overrideLogicalId("member");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `accountId` - (Required) AWS account ID for member account.
* `detectorId` - (Required) The detector ID of the GuardDuty account where you want to create member accounts.
* `email` - (Required) Email address for member account.
* `invite` - (Optional) Boolean whether to invite the account to GuardDuty as a member. Defaults to `false`. To detect if an invitation needs to be (re-)sent, the Terraform state value is `true` based on a `relationshipStatus` of `Disabled`, `Enabled`, `Invited`, or `EmailVerificationInProgress`.
* `invitationMessage` - (Optional) Message for invitation.
* `disableEmailNotification` - (Optional) Boolean whether an email notification is sent to the accounts. Defaults to `false`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The ID of the GuardDuty member
* `relationshipStatus` - The status of the relationship between the member account and its primary account. More information can be found in [Amazon GuardDuty API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/get-members.html).

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

- `create` - (Default `1m`)
- `update` - (Default `1m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import GuardDuty members using the primary GuardDuty detector ID and member AWS account ID. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { GuarddutyMember } from "./.gen/providers/aws/guardduty-member";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    GuarddutyMember.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "myMember",
      "00b00fd5aecc0ab60a708659477e9617:123456789012"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import GuardDuty members using the primary GuardDuty detector ID and member AWS account ID. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_guardduty_member.MyMember 00b00fd5aecc0ab60a708659477e9617:123456789012
```
