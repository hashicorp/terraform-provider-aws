# Resource: aws_directory_service_conditional_forwarder

Provides a conditional forwarder for managed Microsoft AD in AWS Directory Service.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DirectoryServiceConditionalForwarder } from "./.gen/providers/aws/directory-service-conditional-forwarder";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DirectoryServiceConditionalForwarder(this, "example", {
      directoryId: ad.id,
      dnsIps: ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"],
      remoteDomainName: "example.com",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `directoryId` - (Required) ID of directory.
* `dnsIps` - (Required) A list of forwarder IP addresses.
* `remoteDomainName` - (Required) The fully qualified domain name of the remote domain for which forwarders will be used.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports no additional attributes.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import conditional forwarders using the directory id and remote_domain_name. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DirectoryServiceConditionalForwarder } from "./.gen/providers/aws/directory-service-conditional-forwarder";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    DirectoryServiceConditionalForwarder.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "d-1234567890:example.com"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import conditional forwarders using the directory id and remote_domain_name. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_directory_service_conditional_forwarder.example d-1234567890:example.com
```
