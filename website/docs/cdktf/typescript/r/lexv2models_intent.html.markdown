}

resource "aws_lexv2models_bot" "test" {
  name                        = "botens_namn"
  idle_session_ttl_in_seconds = 60
  role_arn                    = aws_iam_role.test.arn

  data_privacy {
    child_directed = true
  }
}

resource "aws_lexv2models_bot_locale" "test" {
  locale_id                        = "en_US"
  bot_id                           = aws_lexv2models_bot.test.id
  bot_version                      = "DRAFT"
  n_lu_intent_confidence_threshold = 0.7
}

resource "aws_lexv2models_bot_version" "test" {
  bot_id = aws_lexv2models_bot.test.id
  locale_specification = {
    (aws_lexv2models_bot_locale.test.locale_id) = {
      source_bot_version = "DRAFT"
    }
  }
}

resource "aws_lexv2models_intent" "example" {
  bot_id      = aws_lexv2models_bot.test.id
  bot_version = aws_lexv2models_bot_locale.test.bot_version
  name        = "botens_namn"
  locale_id   = aws_lexv2models_bot_locale.test.locale_id
}
```

### `confirmationSetting` Example

When using `confirmationSetting`, if you do not provide a `promptAttemptsSpecification`, AWS Lex will provide default `promptAttemptsSpecification`s. As a result, Terraform will report a difference in the configuration. To avoid this behavior, include the default `promptAttemptsSpecification` configuration shown below.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `botId` - (Required) Identifier of the bot associated with this intent.
* `botVersion` - (Required) Version of the bot associated with this intent.
* `localeId` - (Required) Identifier of the language and locale where this intent is used. All of the bots, slot types, and slots used by the intent must have the same locale.
* `name` - (Required) Name of the intent. Intent names must be unique in the locale that contains the intent and cannot match the name of any built-in intent.

The following arguments are optional:

* `closingSetting` - (Optional) Configuration block for the response that Amazon Lex sends to the user when the intent is closed. See [`closingSetting`](#closing_setting).
* `confirmationSetting` - (Optional) Configuration block for prompts that Amazon Lex sends to the user to confirm the completion of an intent. If the user answers "no," the settings contain a statement that is sent to the user to end the intent. If you configure this block without `prompt_specification.*.prompt_attempts_specification`, AWS will provide default configurations for `Initial` and `Retry1` `promptAttemptsSpecification`s. This will cause Terraform to report differences. Use the `confirmationSetting` configuration above in the [Basic Usage](#basic-usage) example to avoid differences resulting from AWS default configuration. See [`confirmationSetting`](#confirmation_setting).
* `description` - (Optional) Description of the intent. Use the description to help identify the intent in lists.
* `dialogCodeHook` - (Optional) Configuration block for invoking the alias Lambda function for each user input. You can invoke this Lambda function to personalize user interaction. See [`dialogCodeHook`](#dialog_code_hook).
* `fulfillmentCodeHook` - (Optional) Configuration block for invoking the alias Lambda function when the intent is ready for fulfillment. You can invoke this function to complete the bot's transaction with the user. See [`fulfillmentCodeHook`](#fulfillment_code_hook).
* `initialResponseSetting` - (Optional) Configuration block for the response that is sent to the user at the beginning of a conversation, before eliciting slot values. See [`initialResponseSetting`](#initial_response_setting).
* `inputContext` - (Optional) Configuration blocks for contexts that must be active for this intent to be considered by Amazon Lex. When an intent has an input context list, Amazon Lex only considers using the intent in an interaction with the user when the specified contexts are included in the active context list for the session. If the contexts are not active, then Amazon Lex will not use the intent. A context can be automatically activated using the outputContexts property or it can be set at runtime. See [`inputContext`](#input_context).
* `kendraConfiguration` - (Optional) Configuration block for information required to use the AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent intent to connect to an Amazon Kendra index. The AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent intent is called when Amazon Lex can't determine another intent to invoke. See [`kendraConfiguration`](#kendra_configuration).
* `outputContext` - (Optional) Configuration blocks for contexts that the intent activates when it is fulfilled. You can use an output context to indicate the intents that Amazon Lex should consider for the next turn of the conversation with a customer. When you use the outputContextsList property, all of the contexts specified in the list are activated when the intent is fulfilled. You can set up to 10 output contexts. You can also set the number of conversation turns that the context should be active, or the length of time that the context should be active. See [`outputContext`](#output_context).
* `parentIntentSignature` - (Optional) Identifier for the built-in intent to base this intent on.
* `sampleUtterance` - (Optional) Configuration block for strings that a user might say to signal the intent. See [`sampleUtterance`](#sample_utterance).
* `slotPriority` - (Optional) Configuration block for a new list of slots and their priorities that are contained by the intent. This is ignored on create and only valid for updates. See [`slotPriority`](#slot_priority).

### `closingSetting`

* `active` - (Optional) Whether an intent's closing response is used. When this field is false, the closing response isn't sent to the user. If the active field isn't specified, the default is true.
* `closingResponse` - (Optional) Configuration block for response that Amazon Lex sends to the user when the intent is complete. See [`closingResponse`](#closing_response).
* `conditional` - (Optional) Configuration block for list of conditional branches associated with the intent's closing response. These branches are executed when the `nextStep` attribute is set to `EvalutateConditional`. See [`conditional`](#conditional).
* `nextStep` - (Optional) Next step that the bot executes after playing the intent's closing response. See [`nextStep`](#next_step).

#### `closingResponse`

* `messageGroup` - (Required) Configuration blocks for responses that Amazon Lex can send to the user. Amazon Lex chooses the actual response to send at runtime. See [`messageGroup`](#message_group).

##### `messageGroup`

* `message` - (Required) Configuration block for the primary message that Amazon Lex should send to the user. See [`message`](#message-and-variation).

* `imageUrl` - (Optional) URL of an image to display on the response card. The image URL must be publicly available so that the platform displaying the response card has access to the image.
* `subtitle` - (Optional) Subtitle to display on the response card. The format of the subtitle is determined by the platform displaying the response card.

###### `button`

* `text` - (Required) Text that appears on the button. Use this to tell the user what value is returned when they choose this button.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Lex V2 Models Intent using the `intent_id:bot_id:bot_version:locale_id`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Lexv2ModelsIntent } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lexv2-models-intent";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    Lexv2ModelsIntent.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "intent-42874:bot-11376:DRAFT:en_US"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Lex V2 Models Intent using the `intent_id:bot_id:bot_version:locale_id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_lexv2models_intent.example intent-42874:bot-11376:DRAFT:en_US
```
