# Resource: aws_spot_fleet_request

Provides an EC2 Spot Fleet Request resource. This allows a fleet of Spot
instances to be requested on the Spot market.

~> **NOTE [AWS strongly discourages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-best-practices.html#which-spot-request-method-to-use) the use of the legacy APIs called by this resource.
We recommend using the [EC2 Fleet](ec2_fleet.html) or [Auto Scaling Group](autoscaling_group.html) resources instead.

## Example Usage

### Using launch specifications

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { SpotFleetRequest } from "./.gen/providers/aws/spot-fleet-request";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new SpotFleetRequest(this, "cheap_compute", {
      allocationStrategy: "diversified",
      iamFleetRole: "arn:aws:iam::12345678:role/spot-fleet",
      launchSpecification: [
        {
          ami: "ami-1234",
          iamInstanceProfileArn: example.arn,
          instanceType: "m4.10xlarge",
          placementTenancy: "dedicated",
          spotPrice: "2.793",
        },
        {
          ami: "ami-5678",
          availabilityZone: "us-west-1a",
          iamInstanceProfileArn: example.arn,
          instanceType: "m4.4xlarge",
          keyName: "my-key",
          rootBlockDevice: [
            {
              volumeSize: Token.asNumber("300"),
              volumeType: "gp2",
            },
          ],
          spotPrice: "1.117",
          subnetId: "subnet-1234",
          tags: {
            Name: "spot-fleet-example",
          },
          weightedCapacity: Token.asString(35),
        },
      ],
      spotPrice: "0.03",
      targetCapacity: 6,
      validUntil: "2019-11-04T20:44:20Z",
    });
  }
}

```

### Using launch templates

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LaunchTemplate } from "./.gen/providers/aws/launch-template";
import { SpotFleetRequest } from "./.gen/providers/aws/spot-fleet-request";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const foo = new LaunchTemplate(this, "foo", {
      imageId: "ami-516b9131",
      instanceType: "m1.small",
      keyName: "some-key",
      name: "launch-template",
    });
    const awsSpotFleetRequestFoo = new SpotFleetRequest(this, "foo_1", {
      dependsOn: [testAttach],
      iamFleetRole: "arn:aws:iam::12345678:role/spot-fleet",
      launchTemplateConfig: [
        {
          launchTemplateSpecification: {
            id: foo.id,
            version: Token.asString(foo.latestVersion),
          },
        },
      ],
      spotPrice: "0.005",
      targetCapacity: 2,
      validUntil: "2019-11-04T20:44:20Z",
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsSpotFleetRequestFoo.overrideLogicalId("foo");
  }
}

```

~> **NOTE:** Terraform does not support the functionality where multiple `subnetId` or `availabilityZone` parameters can be specified in the same
launch configuration block. If you want to specify multiple values, then separate launch configuration blocks should be used or launch template overrides should be configured, one per subnet:

### Using multiple launch specifications

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { SpotFleetRequest } from "./.gen/providers/aws/spot-fleet-request";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new SpotFleetRequest(this, "foo", {
      iamFleetRole: "arn:aws:iam::12345678:role/spot-fleet",
      launchSpecification: [
        {
          ami: "ami-d06a90b0",
          availabilityZone: "us-west-2a",
          instanceType: "m1.small",
          keyName: "my-key",
        },
        {
          ami: "ami-d06a90b0",
          availabilityZone: "us-west-2a",
          instanceType: "m5.large",
          keyName: "my-key",
        },
      ],
      spotPrice: "0.005",
      targetCapacity: 2,
      validUntil: "2019-11-04T20:44:20Z",
    });
  }
}

```

-> In this example, we use a [`dynamic` block](https://www.terraform.io/language/expressions/dynamic-blocks) to define zero or more `launchSpecification` blocks, producing one for each element in the list of subnet ids.

import { SpotFleetRequest } from "./.gen/providers/aws/spot-fleet-request";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    /*Terraform Variables are not always the best fit for getting inputs in the context of Terraform CDK.
    You can read more about this at https://cdk.tf/variables*/
    const subnets = new TerraformVariable(this, "subnets", {});
    /*In most cases loops should be handled in the programming language context and 
    not inside of the Terraform context. If you are looping over something external, e.g. a variable or a file input
    you should consider using a for loop. If you are looping over something only known to Terraform, e.g. a result of a data source
    you need to keep this like it is.*/
    const exampleDynamicIterator0 = TerraformIterator.fromList(
      Token.asAny(
        "${[ for s in ${" +
          subnets.value +
          "} : {\n      subnet_id = s[1]\n    }]}"
      )
    );
    new SpotFleetRequest(this, "example", {
      allocationStrategy: "lowestPrice",
      fleetType: "request",
      iamFleetRole: "arn:aws:iam::12345678:role/spot-fleet",
      targetCapacity: 3,
      terminateInstancesWithExpiration: Token.asBoolean("true"),
      validUntil: "2019-11-04T20:44:20Z",
      waitForFulfillment: Token.asBoolean("true"),
      launchSpecification: exampleDynamicIterator0.dynamic({
        ami: "ami-1234",
        instance_type: "m4.4xlarge",
        root_block_device: [
          {
            delete_on_termination: "true",
            volume_size: "8",
            volume_type: "gp2",
          },
        ],
        subnet_id: Fn.lookupNested(exampleDynamicIterator0.value, [
          "subnet_id",
        ]),
        tags: {
          Name: "Spot Node",
          tag_builder: "builder",
        },
        vpc_security_group_ids: "sg-123456",

```

## Argument Reference

Most of these arguments directly correspond to the
[official API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_SpotFleetRequestConfigData.html).

* `iamFleetRole` - (Required) Grants the Spot fleet permission to terminate
  Spot instances on your behalf when you cancel its Spot fleet request using
CancelSpotFleetRequests or when the Spot fleet request expires, if you set
terminateInstancesWithExpiration.
* `context` - (Optional) Reserved.
* `replaceUnhealthyInstances` - (Optional) Indicates whether Spot fleet should replace unhealthy instances. Default `false`.
* `launchSpecification` - (Optional) Used to define the launch configuration of the
  spot-fleet request. Can be specified multiple times to define different bids
across different markets and instance types. Conflicts with `launch_template_config`. At least one of `launch_specification` or `launch_template_config` is required.

    **Note**: This takes in similar but not
    identical inputs as [`aws_instance`](instance.html).  There are limitations on
    what you can specify. See the list of officially supported inputs in the
    [reference documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_SpotFleetLaunchSpecification.html). Any normal [`aws_instance`](instance.html) parameter that corresponds to those inputs may be used and it have
    a additional parameter `iam_instance_profile_arn` takes `aws_iam_instance_profile` attribute `arn` as input.

* `launchTemplateConfig` - (Optional) Launch template configuration block. See [Launch Template Configs](#launch-template-configs) below for more details. Conflicts with `launch_specification`. At least one of `launch_specification` or `launch_template_config` is required.
* `spotMaintenanceStrategies` - (Optional) Nested argument containing maintenance strategies for managing your Spot Instances that are at an elevated risk of being interrupted. Defined below.
* `spotPrice` - (Optional; Default: On-demand price) The maximum bid price per unit hour.
* `waitForFulfillment` - (Optional; Default: false) If set, Terraform will
  wait for the Spot Request to be fulfilled, and will throw an error if the
  timeout of 10m is reached.
* `targetCapacity` - The number of units to request. You can choose to set the
  target capacity in terms of instances or a performance characteristic that is
  important to your application workload, such as vCPUs, memory, or I/O.
* `targetCapacityUnitType` - (Optional) The unit for the target capacity. This can only be done with `instance_requirements` defined
* `allocationStrategy` - Indicates how to allocate the target capacity across
  the Spot pools specified by the Spot fleet request. Valid values: `lowestPrice`, `diversified`, `capacityOptimized`, `capacityOptimizedPrioritized`, and `priceCapacityOptimized`. The default is
  `lowestPrice`.
* `instancePoolsToUseCount` - (Optional; Default: 1)
  The number of Spot pools across which to allocate your target Spot capacity.
  Valid only when `allocation_strategy` is set to `lowestPrice`. Spot Fleet selects
  the cheapest Spot pools and evenly allocates your target Spot capacity across
  the number of Spot pools that you specify.
* `excessCapacityTerminationPolicy` - Indicates whether running Spot
  instances should be terminated if the target capacity of the Spot fleet
  request is decreased below the current size of the Spot fleet.
* `terminateInstancesWithExpiration` - (Optional) Indicates whether running Spot
  instances should be terminated when the Spot fleet request expires.
* `terminateInstancesOnDelete` - (Optional) Indicates whether running Spot
  instances should be terminated when the resource is deleted (and the Spot fleet request cancelled).
  If no value is specified, the value of the `terminate_instances_with_expiration` argument is used.
* `instanceInterruptionBehaviour` - (Optional) Indicates whether a Spot
  instance stops or terminates when it is interrupted. Default is
  `terminate`.
* `fleetType` - (Optional) The type of fleet request. Indicates whether the Spot Fleet only requests the target
  capacity or also attempts to maintain it. Default is `maintain`.
* `validUntil` - (Optional) The end date and time of the request, in UTC [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.8) format(for example, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ). At this point, no new Spot instance requests are placed or enabled to fulfill the request.
* `validFrom` - (Optional) The start date and time of the request, in UTC [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.8) format(for example, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ). The default is to start fulfilling the request immediately.
* `loadBalancers` (Optional) A list of elastic load balancer names to add to the Spot fleet.
* `targetGroupArns` (Optional) A list of `aws_alb_target_group` ARNs, for use with Application Load Balancing.
* `onDemandAllocationStrategy` - The order of the launch template overrides to use in fulfilling On-Demand capacity. the possible values are: `lowestPrice` and `prioritized`. the default is `lowestPrice`.
* `onDemandMaxTotalPrice` - The maximum amount per hour for On-Demand Instances that you're willing to pay. When the maximum amount you're willing to pay is reached, the fleet stops launching instances even if it hasn’t met the target capacity.
* `onDemandTargetCapacity` - The number of On-Demand units to request. If the request type is `maintain`, you can specify a target capacity of 0 and add capacity later.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

### Launch Template Configs

The `launchTemplateConfig` block supports the following:

* `launchTemplateSpecification` - (Required) Launch template specification. See [Launch Template Specification](#launch-template-specification) below for more details.
* `overrides` - (Optional) One or more override configurations. See [Overrides](#overrides) below for more details.

### Launch Template Specification

* `id` - The ID of the launch template. Conflicts with `name`.
* `name` - The name of the launch template. Conflicts with `id`.
* `version` - (Optional) Template version. Unlike the autoscaling equivalent, does not support `$Latest` or `$Default`, so use the launch_template resource's attribute, e.g., `"${aws_launch_template.foo.latest_version}"`. It will use the default version if omitted.

    **Note:** The specified launch template can specify only a subset of the
    inputs of [`aws_launch_template`](launch_template.html).  There are limitations on
    what you can specify as spot fleet does not support all the attributes that are supported by autoscaling groups. [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html#launch-templates-spot-fleet) is currently sparse, but at least `instance_initiated_shutdown_behavior` is confirmed unsupported.

### spot_maintenance_strategies

* `capacityRebalance` - (Optional) Nested argument containing the capacity rebalance for your fleet request. Defined below.

### capacity_rebalance

* `replacementStrategy` - (Optional) The replacement strategy to use. Only available for spot fleets with `fleet_type` set to `maintain`. Valid values: `launch`.

### Overrides

* `availabilityZone` - (Optional) The availability zone in which to place the request.
* `instanceRequirements` - (Optional) The instance requirements. See below.
* `instanceType` - (Optional) The type of instance to request.
* `priority` - (Optional) The priority for the launch template override. The lower the number, the higher the priority. If no number is set, the launch template override has the lowest priority.
* `spotPrice` - (Optional) The maximum spot bid for this override request.
* `subnetId` - (Optional) The subnet in which to launch the requested instance.
* `weightedCapacity` - (Optional) The capacity added to the fleet by a fulfilled request.

This is the maximum you’ll pay for an On-Demand Instance, expressed as a percentage higher than the cheapest M, C, or R instance type with your specified attributes. When Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects instance types with your attributes, we will exclude instance types whose price is higher than your threshold. The parameter accepts an integer, which Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling interprets as a percentage. To turn off price protection, specify a high value, such as 999999. Default is 20.

    If you set DesiredCapacityType to vcpu or memory-mib, the price protection threshold is applied based on the per vCPU or per memory price instead of the per instance price.
* `requireHibernateSupport` - (Optional) Indicate whether instance types must support On-Demand Instance Hibernation, either `true` or `false`. Default is `false`.
* `spotMaxPricePercentageOverLowestPrice` - (Optional) The price protection threshold for Spot Instances. This is the maximum you’ll pay for a Spot Instance, expressed as a percentage higher than the cheapest M, C, or R instance type with your specified attributes. When Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects instance types with your attributes, we will exclude instance types whose price is higher than your threshold. The parameter accepts an integer, which Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling interprets as a percentage. To turn off price protection, specify a high value, such as 999999. Default is 100.

    If you set DesiredCapacityType to vcpu or memory-mib, the price protection threshold is applied based on the per vCPU or per memory price instead of the per instance price.
* `totalLocalStorageGb` - (Optional) Block describing the minimum and maximum total local storage (GB). Default is no minimum or maximum.
    * `min` - (Optional) Minimum. May be a decimal number, e.g. `0.5`.
    * `max` - (Optional) Maximum. May be a decimal number, e.g. `0.5`.
* `vcpuCount` - (Optional) Block describing the minimum and maximum number of vCPUs. Default is no maximum.
    * `min` - (Optional) Minimum.

* `id` - The Spot fleet request ID
* `spotRequestState` - The state of the Spot fleet request.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `create` - (Default `10m`)
* `delete` - (Default `15m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Spot Fleet Requests using `id`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Spot Fleet Requests using `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_spot_fleet_request.fleet sfr-005e9ec8-5546-4c31-b317-31a62325411e
```
