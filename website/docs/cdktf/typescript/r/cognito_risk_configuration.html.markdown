Provides a Cognito Risk Configuration resource.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { CognitoRiskConfiguration } from "./.gen/providers/aws/cognito-risk-configuration";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new CognitoRiskConfiguration(this, "example", {
      riskExceptionConfiguration: {
        blockedIpRangeList: ["10.10.10.10/32"],
      },
      userPoolId: Token.asString(awsCognitoUserPoolExample.id),
    });
  }
}

```

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The user pool ID or the user pool ID and Client Id separated by a `:` if the configuration is client specific.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Cognito Risk Configurations using the user pool ID or the user pool ID and Client Id separated by a `:`. For example:

Import using the user pool ID:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Import using the user pool ID and Client ID separated by a `:`:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

**Using `terraform import` to import** Cognito Risk Configurations using the user pool ID or the user pool ID and Client Id separated by a `:`. For example:

Import using the user pool ID:

```console
% terraform import aws_cognito_risk_configuration.main example
```

Import using the user pool ID and Client ID separated by a `:`:

```console
% terraform import aws_cognito_risk_configuration.main example:example
```
