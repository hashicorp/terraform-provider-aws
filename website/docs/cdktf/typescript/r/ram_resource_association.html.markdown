# Resource: aws_ram_resource_association

Manages a Resource Access Manager (RAM) Resource Association.

~> *NOTE:* Certain AWS resources (e.g., EC2 Subnets) can only be shared in an AWS account that is a member of an AWS Organizations organization with organization-wide Resource Access Manager functionality enabled. See the [Resource Access Manager User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/what-is.html) and AWS service specific documentation for additional information.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { RamResourceAssociation } from "./.gen/providers/aws/ram-resource-association";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new RamResourceAssociation(this, "example", {
      resourceArn: Token.asString(awsSubnetExample.arn),
      resourceShareArn: Token.asString(awsRamResourceShareExample.arn),
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `resourceArn` - (Required) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource to associate with the RAM Resource Share.
* `resourceShareArn` - (Required) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the RAM Resource Share.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource share.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import RAM Resource Associations using their Resource Share ARN and Resource ARN separated by a comma. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import RAM Resource Associations using their Resource Share ARN and Resource ARN separated by a comma. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_ram_resource_association.example arn:aws:ram:eu-west-1:123456789012:resource-share/73da1ab9-b94a-4ba3-8eb4-45917f7f4b12,arn:aws:ec2:eu-west-1:123456789012:subnet/subnet-12345678
```
