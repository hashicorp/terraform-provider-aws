## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Security Hub insights using the ARN. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { SecurityhubInsight } from "./.gen/providers/aws/securityhub-insight";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    SecurityhubInsight.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-2:1234567890:insight/1234567890/custom/91299ed7-abd0-4e44-a858-d0b15e37141a"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Security Hub insights using the ARN. For example:
