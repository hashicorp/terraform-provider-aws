# Resource: aws_iam_group_policy_attachments_exclusive

Terraform resource for maintaining exclusive management of customer managed policies assigned to an AWS IAM (Identity & Access Management) group.

!> This resource takes exclusive ownership over customer managed policies attached to a group. This includes removal of customer managed policies which are not explicitly configured. To prevent persistent drift, ensure any `aws_iam_group_policy_attachment` resources managed alongside this resource are included in the `policyArns` argument.

~> Destruction of this resource means Terraform will no longer manage reconciliation of the configured policy attachments. It __will not__ detach the configured policies from the group.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { IamGroupPolicyAttachmentsExclusive } from "./.gen/providers/aws/iam-group-policy-attachments-exclusive";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new IamGroupPolicyAttachmentsExclusive(this, "example", {
      groupName: Token.asString(awsIamGroupExample.name),
      policyArns: [Token.asString(awsIamPolicyExample.arn)],
    });
  }
}

```

### Disallow Customer Managed Policies

To automatically remove any configured customer managed policies, set the `policyArns` argument to an empty list.

~> This will not __prevent__ customer managed policies from being assigned to a group via Terraform (or any other interface). This resource enables bringing customer managed policy assignments into a configured state, however, this reconciliation happens only when `apply` is proactively run.

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { IamGroupPolicyAttachmentsExclusive } from "./.gen/providers/aws/iam-group-policy-attachments-exclusive";
interface MyConfig {
  policyArns: any;
}
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string, config: MyConfig) {
    super(scope, name);
    new IamGroupPolicyAttachmentsExclusive(this, "example", {
      groupName: Token.asString(awsIamGroupExample.name),
      policyArns: config.policyArns,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `groupName` - (Required) IAM group name.
* `policyArns` - (Required) A list of customer managed policy ARNs to be attached to the group. Policies attached to this group but not configured in this argument will be removed.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports no additional attributes.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to exclusively manage customer managed policy assignments using the `groupName`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { IamGroupPolicyAttachmentsExclusive } from "./.gen/providers/aws/iam-group-policy-attachments-exclusive";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    IamGroupPolicyAttachmentsExclusive.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "MyGroup"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import exclusive management of customer managed policy assignments using the `groupName`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_iam_group_policy_attachments_exclusive.example MyGroup
```
