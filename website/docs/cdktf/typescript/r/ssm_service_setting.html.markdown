## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import AWS SSM Service Setting using the `settingId`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import AWS SSM Service Setting using the `settingId`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_ssm_service_setting.example arn:aws:ssm:us-east-1:123456789012:servicesetting/ssm/parameter-store/high-throughput-enabled
```
