# Resource: aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls

Provides a resource to manage S3 Bucket Ownership Controls. For more information, see the [S3 Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/about-object-ownership.html).

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { S3Bucket } from "./.gen/providers/aws/s3-bucket";
import { S3BucketOwnershipControls } from "./.gen/providers/aws/s3-bucket-ownership-controls";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new S3Bucket(this, "example", {
      bucket: "example",
    });
    const awsS3BucketOwnershipControlsExample = new S3BucketOwnershipControls(
      this,
      "example_1",
      {
        bucket: example.id,
        rule: {
          objectOwnership: "BucketOwnerPreferred",
        },
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsS3BucketOwnershipControlsExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `bucket` - (Required) Name of the bucket that you want to associate this access point with.
* `rule` - (Required) Configuration block(s) with Ownership Controls rules. Detailed below.

### rule Configuration Block

The following arguments are required:

* `objectOwnership` - (Required) Object ownership. Valid values: `BucketOwnerPreferred`, `ObjectWriter` or `BucketOwnerEnforced`
    * `BucketOwnerPreferred` - Objects uploaded to the bucket change ownership to the bucket owner if the objects are uploaded with the `bucket-owner-full-control` canned ACL.
    * `ObjectWriter` - Uploading account will own the object if the object is uploaded with the `bucket-owner-full-control` canned ACL.
    * `BucketOwnerEnforced` - Bucket owner automatically owns and has full control over every object in the bucket. ACLs no longer affect permissions to data in the S3 bucket.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - S3 Bucket name.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import S3 Bucket Ownership Controls using S3 Bucket name. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import S3 Bucket Ownership Controls using S3 Bucket name. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls.example my-bucket
```
