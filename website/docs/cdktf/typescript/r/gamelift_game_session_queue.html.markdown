# Resource: aws_gamelift_game_session_queue

Provides an GameLift Game Session Queue resource.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { GameliftGameSessionQueue } from "./.gen/providers/aws/gamelift-game-session-queue";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new GameliftGameSessionQueue(this, "test", {
      destinations: [usWest2Fleet.arn, euCentral1Fleet.arn],
      name: "example-session-queue",
      notificationTarget: gameSessionQueueNotifications.arn,
      playerLatencyPolicy: [
        {
          maximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds: 100,
          policyDurationSeconds: 5,
        },
        {
          maximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds: 200,
        },
      ],
      timeoutInSeconds: 60,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the session queue.
* `timeoutInSeconds` - (Required) Maximum time a game session request can remain in the queue.
* `customEventData` - (Optional) Information to be added to all events that are related to this game session queue.
* `destinations` - (Optional) List of fleet/alias ARNs used by session queue for placing game sessions.
* `notificationTarget` - (Optional) An SNS topic ARN that is set up to receive game session placement notifications.
* `playerLatencyPolicy` - (Optional) One or more policies used to choose fleet based on player latency. See below.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

### Nested Fields

#### `playerLatencyPolicy`

* `maximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds` - (Required) Maximum latency value that is allowed for any player.
* `policyDurationSeconds` - (Optional) Length of time that the policy is enforced while placing a new game session. Absence of value for this attribute means that the policy is enforced until the queue times out.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - Game Session Queue ARN.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import GameLift Game Session Queues using their `name`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { GameliftGameSessionQueue } from "./.gen/providers/aws/gamelift-game-session-queue";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    GameliftGameSessionQueue.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "example"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import GameLift Game Session Queues using their `name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_gamelift_game_session_queue.example example
```
