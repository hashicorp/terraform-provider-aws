# Resource: aws_cloudwatch_log_subscription_filter

Provides a CloudWatch Logs subscription filter resource.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { CloudwatchLogSubscriptionFilter } from "./.gen/providers/aws/cloudwatch-log-subscription-filter";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new CloudwatchLogSubscriptionFilter(this, "test_lambdafunction_logfilter", {
      destinationArn: testLogstream.arn,
      distribution: "Random",
      filterPattern: "logtype test",
      logGroupName: "/aws/lambda/example_lambda_name",
      name: "test_lambdafunction_logfilter",
      roleArn: iamForLambda.arn,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) A name for the subscription filter
* `destinationArn` - (Required) The ARN of the destination to deliver matching log events to. Kinesis stream or Lambda function ARN.
* `filterPattern` - (Required) A valid CloudWatch Logs filter pattern for subscribing to a filtered stream of log events. Use empty string `""` to match everything. For more information, see the [Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html).
* `logGroupName` - (Required) The name of the log group to associate the subscription filter with
* `roleArn` - (Optional) The ARN of an IAM role that grants Amazon CloudWatch Logs permissions to deliver ingested log events to the destination. If you use Lambda as a destination, you should skip this argument and use `aws_lambda_permission` resource for granting access from CloudWatch logs to the destination Lambda function.
* `distribution` - (Optional) The method used to distribute log data to the destination. By default log data is grouped by log stream, but the grouping can be set to random for a more even distribution. This property is only applicable when the destination is an Amazon Kinesis stream. Valid values are "Random" and "ByLogStream".

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports no additional attributes.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import CloudWatch Logs subscription filter using the log group name and subscription filter name separated by `|`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { CloudwatchLogSubscriptionFilter } from "./.gen/providers/aws/cloudwatch-log-subscription-filter";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    CloudwatchLogSubscriptionFilter.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "testLambdafunctionLogfilter",
      "/aws/lambda/example_lambda_name|test_lambdafunction_logfilter"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import CloudWatch Logs subscription filter using the log group name and subscription filter name separated by `|`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_cloudwatch_log_subscription_filter.test_lambdafunction_logfilter "/aws/lambda/example_lambda_name|test_lambdafunction_logfilter"
```
