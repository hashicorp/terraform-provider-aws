# Resource: aws_vpn_gateway_attachment

Provides a Virtual Private Gateway attachment resource, allowing for an existing
hardware VPN gateway to be attached and/or detached from a VPC.

-> **Note:** The [`aws_vpn_gateway`](vpn_gateway.html)
resource can also automatically attach the Virtual Private Gateway it creates
to an existing VPC by setting the [`vpcId`](vpn_gateway.html#vpc_id) attribute accordingly.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Vpc } from "./.gen/providers/aws/vpc";
import { VpnGateway } from "./.gen/providers/aws/vpn-gateway";
import { VpnGatewayAttachment } from "./.gen/providers/aws/vpn-gateway-attachment";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const network = new Vpc(this, "network", {
      cidrBlock: "10.0.0.0/16",
    });
    const vpn = new VpnGateway(this, "vpn", {
      tags: {
        Name: "example-vpn-gateway",
      },
    });
    new VpnGatewayAttachment(this, "vpn_attachment", {
      vpcId: network.id,
      vpnGatewayId: vpn.id,
    });
  }
}

```
