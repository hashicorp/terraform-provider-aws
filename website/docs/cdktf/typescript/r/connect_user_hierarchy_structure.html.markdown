## Example Usage

### Basic

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ConnectUserHierarchyStructure } from "./.gen/providers/aws/connect-user-hierarchy-structure";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new ConnectUserHierarchyStructure(this, "example", {
      hierarchyStructure: {
        levelOne: {
          name: "levelone",
        },
      },
      instanceId: "aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-111111111111",
    });
  }
}

```

### With Five Levels

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ConnectUserHierarchyStructure } from "./.gen/providers/aws/connect-user-hierarchy-structure";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new ConnectUserHierarchyStructure(this, "example", {
      hierarchyStructure: {
        levelFive: {
          name: "levelfive",
        },
        levelFour: {
          name: "levelfour",
        },
        levelOne: {
          name: "levelone",
        },
        levelThree: {
          name: "levelthree",
        },
        levelTwo: {
          name: "leveltwo",
        },
      },
      instanceId: "aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-111111111111",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

* `instanceId` - (Required) Specifies the identifier of the hosting Amazon Connect Instance.

A `hierarchyStructure` block supports the following arguments:

* `levelOne` - (Optional) A block that defines the details of level one. The level block is documented below.
* `levelTwo` - (Optional) A block that defines the details of level two. The level block is documented below.
* `levelThree` - (Optional) A block that defines the details of level three. The level block is documented below.
* `levelFour` - (Optional) A block that defines the details of level four. The level block is documented below.
* `levelFive` - (Optional) A block that defines the details of level five. The level block is documented below.

Each level block supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the user hierarchy level. Must not be more than 50 characters.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `hierarchyStructure` - In addition to the arguments defined initially, there are attributes added to the levels created. These additional attributes are documented below.
* `id` - The identifier of the hosting Amazon Connect Instance.

A level block supports the following additional attributes:

* `arn` -  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the hierarchy level.
* `id` -  The identifier of the hierarchy level.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Amazon Connect User Hierarchy Structures using the `instanceId`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Amazon Connect User Hierarchy Structures using the `instanceId`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_connect_user_hierarchy_structure.example f1288a1f-6193-445a-b47e-af739b2
```
