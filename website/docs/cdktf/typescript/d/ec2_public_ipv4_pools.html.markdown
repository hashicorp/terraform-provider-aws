# Data Source: aws_ec2_public_ipv4_pools

Terraform data source for getting information about AWS EC2 Public IPv4 Pools.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.dataAwsEc2PublicIpv4Pools.DataAwsEc2PublicIpv4Pools(
      this,
      "example",
      {}
    );
  }
}

```

### Usage with Filter

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.dataAwsEc2PublicIpv4Pools.DataAwsEc2PublicIpv4Pools(
      this,
      "example",
      {
        filter: [
          {
            name: "tag-key",
            values: ["ExampleTagKey"],
          },
        ],
      }
    );
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are optional:

* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.
* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match a pair on the desired pools.

More complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,
which take the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribePublicIpv4Pools.html).
* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field. Pool IDs will be selected if any one of the given values match.

## Attributes Reference

* `poolIds` - List of all the pool IDs found.
