# Data Source: aws_region

`awsRegion` provides details about a specific AWS region.

As well as validating a given region name this resource can be used to
discover the name of the region configured within the provider. The latter
can be useful in a child module which is inheriting an AWS provider
configuration from its parent module.

## Example Usage

The following example shows how the resource might be used to obtain
the name of the AWS region configured on the provider.

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsRegion } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-region";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsRegion(this, "current", {});
  }
}

```
