 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsDirectoryServiceDirectory } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-directory-service-directory";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsDirectoryServiceDirectory(this, "example", {
      directoryId: main.id,
    });
