 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsKinesisStream } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-kinesis-stream";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsKinesisStream(this, "stream", {
