# Data Source: aws_batch_scheduling_policy

The Batch Scheduling Policy data source allows access to details of a specific Scheduling Policy within AWS Batch.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsBatchSchedulingPolicy } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-batch-scheduling-policy";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsBatchSchedulingPolicy(this, "test", {
      arn: "arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:012345678910:scheduling-policy/example",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `arn` - (Required) ARN of the scheduling policy.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `fairshare_policy` - Fairshare policy block specifies the `computeReservation`, `share_delay_seconds`, and `shareDistribution` of the scheduling policy. The `fairshare_policy` block is documented below.
* `name` - Name of the scheduling policy.
* `tags` - Key-value map of resource tags

A `fairshare_policy` block supports the following arguments:

* `computeReservation` - Value used to reserve some of the available maximum vCPU for fair share identifiers that have not yet been used. For more information, see [FairsharePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_FairsharePolicy.html).
* `share_delay_seconds` - Time period to use to calculate a fair share percentage for each fair share identifier in use, in seconds. For more information, see [FairsharePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_FairsharePolicy.html).
* `shareDistribution` - One or more share distribution blocks which define the weights for the fair share identifiers for the fair share policy. For more information, see [FairsharePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_FairsharePolicy.html). The `shareDistribution` block is documented below.

A `shareDistribution` block supports the following arguments:

* `shareIdentifier` - Fair share identifier or fair share identifier prefix. For more information, see [ShareAttributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_ShareAttributes.html).
* `weightFactor` - Weight factor for the fair share identifier. For more information, see [ShareAttributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_ShareAttributes.html).
