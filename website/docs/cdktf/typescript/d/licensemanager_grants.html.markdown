```typescript

 */
import { DataAwsCallerIdentity } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-caller-identity";
import { DataAwsLicensemanagerGrants } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-licensemanager-grants";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const current = new DataAwsCallerIdentity(this, "current", {});
    new DataAwsLicensemanagerGrants(this, "test", {
      filter: [
        {
          name: "GranteePrincipalARN",
          values: ["arn:aws:iam::${" + current.accountId + "}:root"],
        },
      ],
    });
  }

import { DataAwsLicensemanagerGrants } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-licensemanager-grants";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsLicensemanagerGrants(this, "selected", {
      filter: [
        {
          name: "ProductSKU",
          values: [""],
        },
