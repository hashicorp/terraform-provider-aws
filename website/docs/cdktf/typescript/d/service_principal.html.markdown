# Data Source: aws_service_principal

Use this data source to create a Service Principal Name for a service in a given region. Service Principal Names should always end in the standard global format: `{servicename}.amazonaws.com`. However, in some AWS partitions, AWS may expect a different format.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsServicePrincipal } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-service-principal";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsServicePrincipal(this, "current", {
      serviceName: "s3",
    });
    new DataAwsServicePrincipal(this, "test", {
      region: "us-iso-east-1",
      serviceName: "s3",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

* `serviceName` - (Required) Name of the service you want to generate a Service Principal Name for.
* `region` - (Optional) Region you'd like the SPN for. By default, uses the current region.

## Attribute Reference

* `id` - Identifier of the current Service Principal (compound of service, region and suffix). (e.g. `logs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`in AWS Commercial, `logs.cn-north-1.amazonaws.com.cn` in AWS China).
* `name` - Service Principal Name (e.g., `logs.amazonaws.com` in AWS Commercial, `logs.amazonaws.com.cn` in AWS China).
* `service` - Service used for SPN generation (e.g. `logs`).
* `suffix` - Suffix of the SPN (e.g., `amazonaws.com` in AWS Commercial, `amazonaws.com.cn` in AWS China).
*`region` - Region identifier of the generated SPN (e.g., `us-east-1` in AWS Commercial, `cn-north-1` in AWS China).
