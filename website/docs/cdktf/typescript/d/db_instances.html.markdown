Terraform data source for listing RDS Database Instances.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsDbInstances } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-db-instances";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsDbInstances(this, "example", {
      filter: [
        {
          name: "db-instance-id",
          values: ["my-database-id"],
        },
      ],
    });
  }
}

```

### Using tags

```typescript

import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsDbInstances } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-db-instances";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsDbInstances(this, "example", {
      tags: {
        Env: "test",
      },
    });
  }
}

```
