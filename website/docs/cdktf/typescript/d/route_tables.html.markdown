# Data Source: aws_route_tables

This resource can be useful for getting back a list of route table ids to be referenced elsewhere.

## Example Usage

The following adds a route for a particular cidr block to every (private
kops) route table in a specified vpc to use a particular vpc peering
connection.

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Fn, Token, TerraformCount, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsRouteTables } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-route-tables";
import { Route } from "./.gen/providers/aws/route";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const rts = new DataAwsRouteTables(this, "rts", {
      filter: [
        {
          name: "tag:kubernetes.io/kops/role",
          values: ["private*"],
        },
      ],
      vpcId: vpcId.stringValue,
    });
    /*In most cases loops should be handled in the programming language context and 
    not inside of the Terraform context. If you are looping over something external, e.g. a variable or a file input
    you should consider using a for loop. If you are looping over something only known to Terraform, e.g. a result of a data source
    you need to keep this like it is.*/
    const rCount = TerraformCount.of(Token.asNumber(Fn.lengthOf(rts.ids)));
    new Route(this, "r", {
      destinationCidrBlock: "10.0.0.0/22",
      routeTableId: Token.asString(
        Fn.lookupNested(Fn.tolist(rts.ids), [rCount.index])
      ),
      vpcPeeringConnectionId: "pcx-0e9a7a9ecd137dc54",
      count: rCount,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.

* `vpcId` - (Optional) VPC ID that you want to filter from.

* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match
  a pair on the desired route tables.

More complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,
which take the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by
  [the underlying AWS API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeRouteTables.html).

* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field.
  A Route Table will be selected if any one of the given values matches.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - AWS Region.
* `ids` - List of all the route table ids found.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

- `read` - (Default `20m`)
