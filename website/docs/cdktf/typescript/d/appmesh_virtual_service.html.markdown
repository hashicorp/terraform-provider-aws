# Data Source: aws_appmesh_virtual_service

The App Mesh Virtual Service data source allows details of an App Mesh Virtual Service to be retrieved by its name, mesh_name, and optionally the mesh_owner.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsAppmeshVirtualService } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-appmesh-virtual-service";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsAppmeshVirtualService(this, "test", {
      meshName: "example-mesh",
      name: "example.mesh.local",
    });
  }
}

```

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsAppmeshVirtualService } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-appmesh-virtual-service";
import { DataAwsCallerIdentity } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-caller-identity";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const current = new DataAwsCallerIdentity(this, "current", {});
    new DataAwsAppmeshVirtualService(this, "test", {
      meshName: "example-mesh",
      meshOwner: Token.asString(current.accountId),
      name: "example.mesh.local",
    });
  }
}

```
