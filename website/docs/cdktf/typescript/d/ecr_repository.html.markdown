 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsEcrRepository } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-ecr-repository";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsEcrRepository(this, "service", {
      name: "ecr-repository",
    });
  }
}

```
