# Data Source: aws_odb_cloud_exadata_infrastructure

Terraform data source for exadata infrastructure resource in AWS for Oracle Database@AWS.

You can find out more about Oracle Database@AWS from [User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/odb/latest/UserGuide/what-is-odb.html).

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsOdbCloudExadataInfrastructure } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-odb-cloud-exadata-infrastructure";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsOdbCloudExadataInfrastructure(this, "example", {
      id: "example",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `id` - (Required) The unique identifier of the Exadata infrastructure.

The following arguments are optional:

* `region` - (Optional) Region where this resource will be [managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints). Defaults to the Region set in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#aws-configuration-reference).

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `activatedStorageCount` - The number of storage servers requested for the Exadata infrastructure.
* `additionalStorageCount` - The number of storage servers requested for the Exadata infrastructure.
* `availabilityZone` - The name of the Availability Zone (AZ) where the Exadata infrastructure is located.
* `availabilityZoneId` - The AZ ID of the AZ where the Exadata infrastructure is located.
* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the Exadata infrastructure.
* `id` - The unique identifier of the Exadata infrastructure.
* `computeCount` - The number of database servers for the Exadata infrastructure.
* `cpuCount` - The total number of CPU cores that are allocated to the Exadata infrastructure.
* `dataStorageSizeInTbs` - The size of the Exadata infrastructure's data disk group, in terabytes (TB).
* `dbNodeStorageSizeInGbs` - The size of the storage available on each database node, in gigabytes (GB).
* `dbServerVersion` - The version of the Exadata infrastructure.
* `displayName` - The display name of the Exadata infrastructure.
* `lastMaintenanceRunId` - The Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID) of the last maintenance run for the Exadata infrastructure.
* `maxCpuCount` - The total number of CPU cores available on the Exadata infrastructure.
* `maxDataStorageInTbs` - The total amount of data disk group storage, in terabytes (TB), that's available on the Exadata infrastructure.
* `maxDbNodeStorageSizeInGbs` - The total amount of local node storage, in gigabytes (GB), that's available on the Exadata infrastructure.
* `maxMemoryInGbs` - The total amount of memory, in gigabytes (GB), that's available on the Exadata infrastructure.
* `memorySizeInGbs` - The amount of memory, in gigabytes (GB), that's allocated on the Exadata infrastructure.
* `monthlyDbServerVersion` - The monthly software version of the database servers installed on the Exadata infrastructure.
* `monthlyStorageServerVersion` - The monthly software version of the storage servers installed on the Exadata infrastructure.
* `nextMaintenanceRunId` - The OCID of the next maintenance run for the Exadata infrastructure.
* `ociResourceAnchorName` - The name of the OCI resource anchor for the Exadata infrastructure.
* `ociUrl` - The HTTPS link to the Exadata infrastructure in OCI.
* `ocid` - The OCID of the Exadata infrastructure in OCI.
* `percentProgress` - The amount of progress made on the current operation on the Exadata infrastructure expressed as a percentage.
* `shape` - The model name of the Exadata infrastructure.
* `status` - The status of the Exadata infrastructure.
* `statusReason` - Additional information about the status of the Exadata infrastructure.
* `storageCount` - The number of storage servers that are activated for the Exadata infrastructure.
* `storageServerVersion` - The software version of the storage servers on the Exadata infrastructure.
* `totalStorageSizeInGbs` - The total amount of storage, in gigabytes (GB), on the Exadata infrastructure.
* `computeModel` - The OCI compute model used when you create or clone an instance: ECPU or OCPU. An ECPU is an abstracted measure of compute resources. ECPUs are based on the number of cores elastically allocated from a pool of compute and storage servers. An OCPU is a legacy physical measure of compute resources. OCPUs are based on the physical core of a processor with hyper-threading enabled.
* `createdAt` - The time when the Exadata infrastructure was created.
* `databaseServerType` - The database server model type of the Exadata infrastructure. For the list of valid model names, use the ListDbSystemShapes operation.
* `storageServerType` - The storage server model type of the Exadata infrastructure. For the list of valid model names, use the ListDbSystemShapes operation.
* `maintenanceWindow` - The scheduling details of the maintenance window. Patching and system updates take place during the maintenance window.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the exadata infrastructure. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
