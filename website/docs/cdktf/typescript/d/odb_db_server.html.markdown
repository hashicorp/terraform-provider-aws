# Data Source: aws_odb_db_server

Terraform data source for manging db server linked to exadata infrastructure of Oracle Database@AWS.

You can find out more about Oracle Database@AWS from [User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/odb/latest/UserGuide/what-is-odb.html).

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsOdbDbServer } from "./.gen/providers/aws/";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsOdbDbServer(this, "example", {
      cloud_exadata_infrastructure_id: "exadata_infra_id",
      id: "db_server_id",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `cloudExadataInfrastructureId` - (Required) The unique identifier of the cloud vm cluster.
* `id` - (Required) The unique identifier of db node associated with vm cluster.

The following arguments are optional:

* `region` - (Optional) Region where this resource will be [managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints). Defaults to the Region set in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#aws-configuration-reference).

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `autonomous_virtual_machine_ids` - The list of unique identifiers for the Autonomous VMs associated with this database server.
* `autonomous_vm_cluster_ids` - The OCID of the autonomous VM clusters that are associated with the database server.
* `computeModel` - The compute model of the database server.
* `status` - The status of the database server.
* `statusReason` - Additional information about the current status of the database server.
* `cpuCoreCount` - The number of CPU cores enabled on the database server.
* `dbNodeStorageSizeInGbs` - The allocated local node storage in GBs on the database server.
* `db_server_patching_details` - The scheduling details for the quarterly maintenance window. Patching and system updates take place during the maintenance window.
* `displayName` - The display name of the database server.
* `exadata_infrastructure_id` - The exadata infrastructure ID of the database server.
