# Data Source: aws_arn

Parses an ARN into its constituent parts.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsArn } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-arn";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsArn(this, "db_instance", {
      arn: "arn:aws:rds:eu-west-1:123456789012:db:mysql-db",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `arn` - (Required) ARN to parse.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `partition` - Partition that the resource is in.
* `service` - The [service namespace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#genref-aws-service-namespaces) that identifies the AWS product.
* `region` - Region the resource resides in.
Note that the ARNs for some resources do not include a Region, so this component might be omitted.
* `account` - The [ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/acct-identifiers.html) of the AWS account that owns the resource, without the hyphens.
* `resource` - Content of this part of the ARN varies by service.
It often includes an indicator of the type of resource—for example, an IAM user or Amazon RDS database —followed by a slash (/) or a colon (:), followed by the resource name itself.
