# Data Source: aws_efs_file_system

Provides information about an Elastic File System (EFS) File System.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { VariableType, TerraformVariable, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsEfsFileSystem } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-efs-file-system";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    /*Terraform Variables are not always the best fit for getting inputs in the context of Terraform CDK.
    You can read more about this at https://cdk.tf/variables*/
    const fileSystemId = new TerraformVariable(this, "file_system_id", {
      default: "",
      type: VariableType.STRING,
    });
    new DataAwsEfsFileSystem(this, "by_id", {
      fileSystemId: fileSystemId.stringValue,
    });
    new DataAwsEfsFileSystem(this, "by_tag", {
      tags: {
        Environment: "dev",
      },
    });
  }
}

```
