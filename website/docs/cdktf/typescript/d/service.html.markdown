# Data Source: aws_service

Use this data source to compose and decompose AWS service DNS names.

## Example Usage

### Get Service DNS Name

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsRegion } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-region";
import { DataAwsService } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-service";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const current = new DataAwsRegion(this, "current", {});
    new DataAwsService(this, "test", {
      region: Token.asString(current.name),
      serviceId: "ec2",
    });
  }
}

```

### Use Service Reverse DNS Name to Get Components

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsService } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-service";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsService(this, "s3", {
      reverseDnsName: "cn.com.amazonaws.cn-north-1.s3",
    });
  }
}

```

### Determine Regional Support for a Service

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsService } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-service";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsService(this, "s3", {
      reverseDnsName: "com.amazonaws.us-gov-west-1.waf",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are optional:

* `dnsName` - (Optional) DNS name of the service (_e.g.,_ `rds.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`). One of `dnsName`, `reverseDnsName`, or `serviceId` is required.
* `partition` - (Optional) Partition corresponding to the region.
* `region` - (Optional) Region of the service (_e.g.,_ `us-west-2`, `ap-northeast-1`).
* `reverseDnsName` - (Optional) Reverse DNS name of the service (_e.g.,_ `com.amazonaws.us-west-2.s3`). One of `dnsName`, `reverseDnsName`, or `serviceId` is required.
* `reverseDnsPrefix` - (Optional) Prefix of the service (_e.g.,_ `com.amazonaws` in AWS Commercial, `cn.com.amazonaws` in AWS China).
* `serviceId` - (Optional) Service endpoint ID (_e.g.,_ `s3`, `rds`, `ec2`). One of `dnsName`, `reverseDnsName`, or `serviceId` is required. A service's endpoint ID can be found in the [_AWS General Reference_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-service-information.html).

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `supported` - Whether the service is supported in the region's partition. New services may not be listed immediately as supported.
