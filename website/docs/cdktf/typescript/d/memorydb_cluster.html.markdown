# Resource: aws_memorydb_cluster

Provides information about a MemoryDB Cluster.

## Example Usage

```typescript

import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsMemorydbCluster } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-memorydb-cluster";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsMemorydbCluster(this, "example", {
      name: "my-cluster",
    });
  }
}

```

* `name` - (Required) Name of the cluster.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - Same as `name`.
* `arn` - ARN of the cluster.
* `aclName` - Name of the Access Control List associated with the cluster.
* `autoMinorVersionUpgrade` - True when the cluster allows automatic minor version upgrades.
* `clusterEndpoint`
    * `address` - DNS hostname of the cluster configuration endpoint.
    * `port` - Port number that the cluster configuration endpoint is listening on.
