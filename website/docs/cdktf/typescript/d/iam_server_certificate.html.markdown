import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*

 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsIamServerCertificate } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-iam-server-certificate";
import { Elb } from "./.gen/providers/aws/elb";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const myDomain = new DataAwsIamServerCertificate(this, "my-domain", {
      latest: true,
      namePrefix: "my-domain.org",
    });
    new Elb(this, "elb", {
      listener: [
        {
          instancePort: 8000,
          instanceProtocol: "https",
          lbPort: 443,
          lbProtocol: "https",
          sslCertificateId: Token.asString(myDomain.arn),
        },
      ],
      name: "my-domain-elb",
    });
  }
}
