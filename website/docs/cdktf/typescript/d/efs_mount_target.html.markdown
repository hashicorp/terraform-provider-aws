import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { VariableType, TerraformVariable, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsEfsMountTarget } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-efs-mount-target";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    /*Terraform Variables are not always the best fit for getting inputs in the context of Terraform CDK.
    You can read more about this at https://cdk.tf/variables*/
    const mountTargetId = new TerraformVariable(this, "mount_target_id", {
      default: "",
      type: VariableType.STRING,
    });
    new DataAwsEfsMountTarget(this, "by_id", {
      mountTargetId: mountTargetId.stringValue,
    });
  }
}

```
