# Data Source: aws_s3_objects

~> **NOTE on `maxKeys`:** Retrieving very large numbers of keys can adversely affect Terraform's performance.

The objects data source returns keys (i.e., file names) and other metadata about objects in an S3 bucket.

## Example Usage

The following example retrieves a list of all object keys in an S3 bucket and creates corresponding Terraform object data sources:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Fn, Token, TerraformCount, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsS3Object } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-s3-object";
import { DataAwsS3Objects } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-s3-objects";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const myObjects = new DataAwsS3Objects(this, "my_objects", {
      bucket: "ourcorp",
    });
    /*In most cases loops should be handled in the programming language context and 
    not inside of the Terraform context. If you are looping over something external, e.g. a variable or a file input
    you should consider using a for loop. If you are looping over something only known to Terraform, e.g. a result of a data source
    you need to keep this like it is.*/
    const objectInfoCount = TerraformCount.of(
      Token.asNumber(Fn.lengthOf(myObjects.keys))
    );
    new DataAwsS3Object(this, "object_info", {
      bucket: Token.asString(myObjects.id),
      key: Token.asString(
        Fn.element(myObjects.keys, Token.asNumber(objectInfoCount.index))
      ),
      count: objectInfoCount,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `bucket` - (Required) Lists object keys in this S3 bucket. Alternatively, an [S3 access point](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-access-points.html) ARN can be specified
* `prefix` - (Optional) Limits results to object keys with this prefix (Default: none)
* `delimiter` - (Optional) Character used to group keys (Default: none)
* `encodingType` - (Optional) Encodes keys using this method (Default: none; besides none, only "url" can be used)
* `maxKeys` - (Optional) Maximum object keys to return (Default: 1000)
* `startAfter` - (Optional) Returns key names lexicographically after a specific object key in your bucket (Default: none; S3 lists object keys in UTF-8 character encoding in lexicographical order)
* `fetchOwner` - (Optional) Boolean specifying whether to populate the owner list (Default: false)
* `requestPayer` - (Optional) Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their requests. If included, the only valid value is `requester`.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `keys` - List of strings representing object keys
* `commonPrefixes` - List of any keys between `prefix` and the next occurrence of `delimiter` (i.e., similar to subdirectories of the `prefix` "directory"); the list is only returned when you specify `delimiter`
* `id` - S3 Bucket.
* `owners` - List of strings representing object owner IDs (see `fetchOwner` above)
* `requestCharged` - If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request.
