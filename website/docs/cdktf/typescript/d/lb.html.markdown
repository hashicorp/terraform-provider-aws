# Data Source: aws_lb

~> **Note:** `aws_alb` is known as `aws_lb`. The functionality is identical.

Provides information about a Load Balancer.

This data source can prove useful when a module accepts an LB as an input
variable and needs to, for example, determine the security groups associated
with it, etc.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { VariableType, TerraformVariable, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsLb } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-lb";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    /*Terraform Variables are not always the best fit for getting inputs in the context of Terraform CDK.
    You can read more about this at https://cdk.tf/variables*/
    const lbArn = new TerraformVariable(this, "lb_arn", {
      default: "",
      type: VariableType.STRING,
    });
    const lbName = new TerraformVariable(this, "lb_name", {
      default: "",
      type: VariableType.STRING,
    });
    new DataAwsLb(this, "test", {
      arn: lbArn.stringValue,
      name: lbName.stringValue,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `arn` - (Optional) Full ARN of the load balancer.
* `name` - (Optional) Unique name of the load balancer.
* `tags` - (Optional) Mapping of tags, each pair of which must exactly match a pair on the desired load balancer.

~> **NOTE:** When both `arn` and `name` are specified, `arn` takes precedence. `tags` has lowest precedence.

## Attribute Reference

See the [LB Resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/lb.html) for details on the
returned attributes - they are identical.

## Timeouts
