# Data Source: aws_cloudfront_response_headers_policy

Use this data source to retrieve information about a CloudFront cache policy.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsCloudfrontResponseHeadersPolicy } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-cloudfront-response-headers-policy";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsCloudfrontResponseHeadersPolicy(this, "example", {
      name: "example-policy",
    });
  }
}

```

### AWS-Managed Policies

AWS managed response header policy names are prefixed with `Managed-`:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsCloudfrontResponseHeadersPolicy } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-cloudfront-response-headers-policy";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsCloudfrontResponseHeadersPolicy(this, "example", {
      name: "Managed-SimpleCORS",
    });
  }
}

```
