# Data Source: aws_budgets_budget

Terraform data source for managing an AWS Web Services Budgets Budget.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsBudgetsBudget } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-budgets-budget";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsBudgetsBudget(this, "test", {
      name: Token.asString(awsBudgetsBudgetTest.name),
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `name` - The name of a budget. Unique within accounts.

The following arguments are optional:

* `accountId` - The ID of the target account for budget. Will use current user's account_id by default if omitted.
* `namePrefix` - The prefix of the name of a budget. Unique within accounts.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `autoAdjustData` - Object containing [AutoAdjustData] which determines the budget amount for an auto-adjusting budget.
* `budgetExceeded` - Boolean indicating whether this budget has been exceeded.
* `budgetLimit` - The total amount of cost, usage, RI utilization, RI coverage, Savings Plans utilization, or Savings Plans coverage that you want to track with your budget. Contains object [Spend](#spend).
* `budgetType` - Whether this budget tracks monetary cost or usage.
* `calculatedSpend` - The spend objects that are associated with this budget. The [actualSpend](#actual-spend) tracks how much you've used, cost, usage, RI units, or Savings Plans units and the [forecastedSpend](#forecasted-spend) tracks how much that you're predicted to spend based on your historical usage profile.
* `costFilter` - A list of [CostFilter](#cost-filter) name/values pair to apply to budget.
* `costTypes` - Object containing [CostTypes](#cost-types) The types of cost included in a budget, such as tax and subscriptions.
* `notification` - Object containing [Budget Notifications](#budget-notification). Can be used multiple times to define more than one budget notification.
* `plannedLimit` - Object containing [Planned Budget Limits](#planned-budget-limits). Can be used multiple times to plan more than one budget limit. See [PlannedBudgetLimits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_budgets_Budget.html#awscostmanagement-Type-budgets_Budget-PlannedBudgetLimits) documentation.
* `tags` - Map of tags assigned to the resource.
* `timePeriodEnd` - The end of the time period covered by the budget. There are no restrictions on the end date. Format: `2017-01-01_12:00`.
* `timePeriodStart` - The start of the time period covered by the budget. If you don't specify a start date, AWS defaults to the start of your chosen time period. The start date must come before the end date. Format: `2017-01-01_12:00`.
* `timeUnit` - The length of time until a budget resets the actual and forecasted spend. Valid values: `MONTHLY`, `QUARTERLY`, `ANNUALLY`, and `DAILY`.

### Actual Spend
