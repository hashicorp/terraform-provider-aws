# Data Source: aws_codebuild_fleet

Retrieve information about an CodeBuild Fleet.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { CodebuildFleet } from "./.gen/providers/aws/codebuild-fleet";
import { DataAwsCodebuildFleet } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-codebuild-fleet";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const test = new CodebuildFleet(this, "test", {
      baseCapacity: 2,
      computeType: "BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL",
      environmentType: "LINUX_CONTAINER",
      name: "full-example-codebuild-fleet",
      overflowBehavior: "QUEUE",
      scalingConfiguration: {
        maxCapacity: 5,
        scalingType: "TARGET_TRACKING_SCALING",
        targetTrackingScalingConfigs: [
          {
            metricType: "FLEET_UTILIZATION_RATE",
            targetValue: 97.5,
          },
        ],
      },
    });
    const dataAwsCodebuildFleetTest = new DataAwsCodebuildFleet(
      this,
      "test_1",
      {
        name: test.name,
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    dataAwsCodebuildFleetTest.overrideLogicalId("test");
  }
}

```

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsCodebuildFleet } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-codebuild-fleet";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsCodebuildFleet(this, "example", {
      name: "my-codebuild-fleet-name",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `name` - (Required) Fleet name.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - ARN of the Fleet.
* `baseCapacity` - Number of machines allocated to the ﬂeet.
* `compute_configuration` - Compute configuration of the compute fleet.
    * `disk` - Amount of disk space of the instance type included in the fleet.
