import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformOutput, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsEips } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-eips";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new DataAwsEips(this, "example", {
      tags: {
        Env: "dev",
      },
    });
    new TerraformOutput(this, "allocation_ids", {
      value: example.allocationIds,
    });
    new TerraformOutput(this, "public_ips", {
      value: example.publicIps,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.
* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match a pair on the desired Elastic IPs.

More complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks, which take the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by
  [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAddresses.html).
* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field. An Elastic IP will be selected if any one of the given values matches.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - AWS Region.
* `allocationIds` - List of all the allocation IDs for address for use with EC2-VPC.
* `publicIps` - List of all the Elastic IP addresses.
