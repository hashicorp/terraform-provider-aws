 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsEips } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-eips";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new DataAwsEips(this, "example", {
      tags: {
        Env: "dev",
      },
    });
    new TerraformOutput(this, "allocation_ids", {
      value: example.allocationIds,
    });
    new TerraformOutput(this, "public_ips", {
      value: example.publicIps,
    });
