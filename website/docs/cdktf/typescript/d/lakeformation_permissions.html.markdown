# Data Source: aws_lakeformation_permissions

Get permissions for a principal to access metadata in the Data Catalog and data organized in underlying data storage such as Amazon S3. Permissions are granted to a principal, in a Data Catalog, relative to a Lake Formation resource, which includes the Data Catalog, databases, tables, LF-tags, and LF-tag policies. For more information, see [Security and Access Control to Metadata and Data in Lake Formation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/security-data-access.html).

~> **NOTE:** This data source deals with explicitly granted permissions. Lake Formation grants implicit permissions to data lake administrators, database creators, and table creators. For more information, see [Implicit Lake Formation Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/implicit-permissions.html).

## Example Usage

### Permissions For A Lake Formation S3 Resource

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsLakeformationPermissions } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-lakeformation-permissions";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsLakeformationPermissions(this, "test", {
      dataLocation: {
        arn: Token.asString(awsLakeformationResourceTest.arn),
      },
      principal: workflowRole.arn,
    });
  }
}

```

### Permissions For A Glue Catalog Database

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsLakeformationPermissions } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-lakeformation-permissions";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsLakeformationPermissions(this, "test", {
      database: {
        catalogId: "110376042874",
        name: Token.asString(awsGlueCatalogDatabaseTest.name),
      },
      principal: workflowRole.arn,
    });
  }
}

```

### Permissions For Tag-Based Access Control

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsLakeformationPermissions } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-lakeformation-permissions";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsLakeformationPermissions(this, "test", {
      lfTagPolicy: {
        expression: [
          {
            key: "Team",
            values: ["Sales"],
          },
          {
            key: "Environment",
            values: ["Dev", "Production"],
          },
        ],
        resourceType: "DATABASE",
      },
      principal: workflowRole.arn,
    });
  }
}

```
