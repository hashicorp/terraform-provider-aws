# Data Source: aws_licensemanager_received_licenses

This resource can be used to get a set of license ARNs matching a filter.

## Example Usage

The following shows getting all license ARNs issued from the AWS marketplace. Providing no filter, would provide all license ARNs for the entire account.

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsLicensemanagerReceivedLicenses } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-licensemanager-received-licenses";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsLicensemanagerReceivedLicenses(this, "test", {
      filter: [
        {
          name: "IssuerName",
          values: ["AWS/Marketplace"],
        },
      ],
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.

More complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,
which take the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by
  [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/license-manager/latest/APIReference/API_ListReceivedLicenses.html#API_ListReceivedLicenses_RequestSyntax).
  For example, if filtering using `ProductSKU`, use:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsLicensemanagerReceivedLicenses } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-licensemanager-received-licenses";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsLicensemanagerReceivedLicenses(this, "selected", {
      filter: [
        {
          name: "ProductSKU",
          values: [""],
        },
      ],
    });
  }
}

```

* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field.
