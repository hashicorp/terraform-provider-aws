~> **NOTE:** Global quotas apply to all AWS regions, but can only be accessed in `us-east-1` in the Commercial partition or `us-gov-west-1` in the GovCloud partition. In other regions, the AWS API will return the error `The request failed because the specified service does not exist.`

import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*

 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsServicequotasService } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-servicequotas-service";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsServicequotasService(this, "example", {
      serviceName: "Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)",
    });
