import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*

 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsServicequotasService } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-servicequotas-service";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsServicequotasService(this, "example", {

    });
