# Data Source: aws_route53_traffic_policy_document

Generates an Route53 traffic policy document in JSON format for use with resources that expect policy documents such as [`awsRoute53TrafficPolicy`](/docs/providers/aws/r/route53_traffic_policy.html).

## Example Usage

### Basic Example

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsRegion } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-region";
import { DataAwsRoute53TrafficPolicyDocument } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-route53-traffic-policy-document";
import { Route53TrafficPolicy } from "./.gen/providers/aws/route53-traffic-policy";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const current = new DataAwsRegion(this, "current", {});
    const example = new DataAwsRoute53TrafficPolicyDocument(this, "example", {
      endpoint: [
        {
          id: "my_elb",
          type: "elastic-load-balancer",
          value: "elb-111111.${" + current.name + "}.elb.amazonaws.com",
        },
        {
          id: "site_down_banner",
          region: Token.asString(current.name),
          type: "s3-website",
          value: "www.example.com",
        },
      ],
      recordType: "A",
      rule: [
        {
          id: "site_switch",
          primary: {
            endpointReference: "my_elb",
          },
          secondary: {
            endpointReference: "site_down_banner",
          },
          type: "failover",
        },
      ],
      startRule: "site_switch",
    });
    const awsRoute53TrafficPolicyExample = new Route53TrafficPolicy(
      this,
      "example_2",
      {
        comment: "example comment",
        document: Token.asString(example.json),
        name: "example",
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsRoute53TrafficPolicyExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

### Complex Example

The following example showcases the use of nested rules within the traffic policy document and introduces the `geoproximity` rule type.

 */

  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new DataAwsRoute53TrafficPolicyDocument(this, "example", {

          },
          type: "failover",
        },
        {
          geoProximityLocation: [
            {
              bias: Token.asString(10),
              evaluateTargetHealth: true,
              region: "aws:route53:us-west-1",
              ruleReference: "na_rule",
            },
            {
              bias: Token.asString(10),
              endpointReference: "eu_endpoint",
              evaluateTargetHealth: true,
              region: "aws:route53:eu-west-1",
            },
            {
              bias: Token.asString(0),
              endpointReference: "ap_endpoint",
              evaluateTargetHealth: true,
              region: "aws:route53:ap-northeast-2",
            },
          ],
          id: "geoproximity_rule",
          type: "geoproximity",
        },
      ],
      startRule: "geoproximity_rule",
    });
    const awsRoute53TrafficPolicyExample = new Route53TrafficPolicy(
      this,
      "example_1",
      {
        comment: "example comment",
        document: Token.asString(example.json),
        name: "example",
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsRoute53TrafficPolicyExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```
