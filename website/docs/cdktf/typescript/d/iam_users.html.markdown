# Data Source: aws_iam_users

Use this data source to get the ARNs and Names of IAM Users.

## Example Usage

### All users in an account

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsIamUsers } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-iam-users";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsIamUsers(this, "users", {});
  }
}

```

### Users filtered by name regex

Users whose username contains `abc`

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsIamUsers } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-iam-users";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsIamUsers(this, "users", {
      nameRegex: ".*abc.*",
    });
  }
}

```

### Users filtered by path prefix

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsIamUsers } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-iam-users";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsIamUsers(this, "users", {
      pathPrefix: "/custom-path",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `nameRegex` - (Optional) Regex string to apply to the IAM users list returned by AWS. This allows more advanced filtering not supported from the AWS API. This filtering is done locally on what AWS returns, and could have a performance impact if the result is large. Combine this with other options to narrow down the list AWS returns.
* `pathPrefix` - (Optional) Path prefix for filtering the results. For example, the prefix `/division_abc/subdivision_xyz/` gets all users whose path starts with `/division_abc/subdivision_xyz/`. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (`/`), listing all users. For more details, check out [list-users in the AWS CLI reference][1].

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arns` - Set of ARNs of the matched IAM users.
* `names` - Set of Names of the matched IAM users.
