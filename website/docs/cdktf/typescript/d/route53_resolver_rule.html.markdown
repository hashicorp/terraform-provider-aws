 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsRoute53ResolverRule } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-route53-resolver-rule";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsRoute53ResolverRule(this, "example", {
      domainName: "subdomain.example.com",
      ruleType: "SYSTEM",
    });
