# Data Source: aws_security_groups

Use this data source to get IDs and VPC membership of Security Groups that are created outside of Terraform.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsSecurityGroups } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-security-groups";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsSecurityGroups(this, "test", {
      tags: {
        Application: "k8s",
        Environment: "dev",
      },
    });
  }
}

```

import { DataAwsSecurityGroups } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-security-groups";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsSecurityGroups(this, "test", {
      filter: [
        {
          name: "group-name",
          values: ["*nodes*"],
        },
        {
          name: "vpc-id",
          values: [vpcId.stringValue],
        },
      ],
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match for desired security groups.
* `filter` - (Optional) One or more name/value pairs to use as filters. There are several valid keys, for a full reference, check out [describe-security-groups in the AWS CLI reference][1].

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arns` - ARNs of the matched security groups.
* `id` - AWS Region.
* `ids` - IDs of the matches security groups.
* `vpcIds` - VPC IDs of the matched security groups. The data source's tag or filter *will span VPCs* unless the `vpc-id` filter is also used.
