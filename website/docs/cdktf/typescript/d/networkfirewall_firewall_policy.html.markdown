# Data Source: aws_networkfirewall_firewall_policy

Retrieve information about a firewall policy.

## Example Usage

### Find firewall policy by name

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsNetworkfirewallFirewallPolicy } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-networkfirewall-firewall-policy";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsNetworkfirewallFirewallPolicy(this, "example", {
      name: firewallPolicyName.stringValue,
    });
  }
}

```

### Find firewall policy by ARN

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsNetworkfirewallFirewallPolicy } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-networkfirewall-firewall-policy";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsNetworkfirewallFirewallPolicy(this, "example", {
      arn: firewallPolicyArn.stringValue,
    });
  }
}

```

### Find firewall policy by name and ARN

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsNetworkfirewallFirewallPolicy } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-networkfirewall-firewall-policy";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsNetworkfirewallFirewallPolicy(this, "example", {
      arn: firewallPolicyArn.stringValue,
      name: firewallPolicyName.stringValue,
    });
  }
}

```

AWS Network Firewall does not allow multiple firewall policies with the same name to be created in an account. It is possible, however, to have multiple firewall policies available in a single account with identical `name` values but distinct `arn` values, e.g. firewall policies shared via a [Resource Access Manager (RAM) share][1]. In that case specifying `arn`, or `name` and `arn`, is recommended.

~> **Note:** If there are multiple firewall policies in an account with the same `name`, and `arn` is not specified, the default behavior will return the firewall policy with `name` that was created in the account.

## Argument Reference

One or more of the following arguments are required:

* `arn` - ARN of the firewall policy.
* `name` - Descriptive name of the firewall policy.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `description` - Description of the firewall policy.
* `firewallPolicy` - The [policy][2] for the specified firewall policy.
* `tags` - Key-value tags for the firewall policy.
* `updateToken` - Token used for optimistic locking.
