# Data Source: aws_prometheus_workspaces

Provides the aliases, ARNs, and workspace IDs of Amazon Prometheus workspaces.

## Example Usage

The following example returns all of the workspaces in a region:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsPrometheusWorkspaces } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-prometheus-workspaces";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsPrometheusWorkspaces(this, "example", {});
  }
}

```

The following example filters the workspaces by alias. Only the workspaces with
aliases that begin with the value of `aliasPrefix` will be returned:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsPrometheusWorkspaces } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-prometheus-workspaces";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsPrometheusWorkspaces(this, "example", {
      aliasPrefix: "example",
    });
  }
}

```
