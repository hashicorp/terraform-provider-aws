class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.dataAwsEc2TransitGatewayPeeringAttachment.DataAwsEc2TransitGatewayPeeringAttachment(
      this,
      "example",
      {
        filter: [
          {
            name: "transit-gateway-attachment-id",
