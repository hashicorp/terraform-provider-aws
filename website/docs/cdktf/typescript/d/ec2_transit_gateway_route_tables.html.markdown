# Data Source: aws_ec2_transit_gateway_route_tables

Provides information for multiple EC2 Transit Gateway Route Tables, such as their identifiers.

## Example Usage

The following shows outputting all Transit Gateway Route Table Ids.

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformOutput, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsEc2TransitGatewayRouteTables } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-ec2-transit-gateway-route-tables";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new DataAwsEc2TransitGatewayRouteTables(
      this,
      "example",
      {}
    );
    const cdktfTerraformOutputExample = new TerraformOutput(this, "example_1", {
      value: example.ids,
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    cdktfTerraformOutputExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.

* `tags` - (Optional) Mapping of tags, each pair of which must exactly match
  a pair on the desired transit gateway route table.

More complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,
which take the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by
  [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeTransitGatewayRouteTables.html).

* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field.
  A Transit Gateway Route Table will be selected if any one of the given values matches.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - AWS Region.
* `ids` - Set of Transit Gateway Route Table identifiers.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

- `read` - (Default `20m`)
