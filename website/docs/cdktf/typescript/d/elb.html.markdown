# aws_elb

Provides information about a "classic" Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).
See [LB Data Source](/docs/providers/aws/d/lb.html) if you are looking for "v2"
Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB).

This data source can prove useful when a module accepts an LB as an input
variable and needs to, for example, determine the security groups associated
with it, etc.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { VariableType, TerraformVariable, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsElb } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-elb";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    /*Terraform Variables are not always the best fit for getting inputs in the context of Terraform CDK.
    You can read more about this at https://cdk.tf/variables*/
    const lbName = new TerraformVariable(this, "lb_name", {
      default: "",
      type: VariableType.STRING,
    });
    new DataAwsElb(this, "test", {
      name: lbName.stringValue,
    });
  }
}

```
