# Data Source: aws_identitystore_user

Use this data source to get an Identity Store User.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Fn, Token, TerraformOutput, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsIdentitystoreUser } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-identitystore-user";
import { DataAwsSsoadminInstances } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-ssoadmin-instances";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new DataAwsSsoadminInstances(this, "example", {});
    const dataAwsIdentitystoreUserExample = new DataAwsIdentitystoreUser(
      this,
      "example_1",
      {
        alternateIdentifier: {
          uniqueAttribute: {
            attributePath: "UserName",
            attributeValue: "ExampleUser",
          },
        },
        identityStoreId: Token.asString(
          Fn.lookupNested(Fn.tolist(example.identityStoreIds), ["0"])
        ),
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    dataAwsIdentitystoreUserExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
    new TerraformOutput(this, "user_id", {
      value: dataAwsIdentitystoreUserExample.userId,
    });
  }
}

```
