# Data Source: aws_ecs_task_definition

The ECS task definition data source allows access to details of
a specific AWS ECS task definition.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsEcsTaskDefinition } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-ecs-task-definition";
import { EcsCluster } from "./.gen/providers/aws/ecs-cluster";
import { EcsService } from "./.gen/providers/aws/ecs-service";
import { EcsTaskDefinition } from "./.gen/providers/aws/ecs-task-definition";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const foo = new EcsCluster(this, "foo", {
      name: "foo",
    });
    const mongo = new EcsTaskDefinition(this, "mongo", {
      containerDefinitions:
        '[\n  {\n    "cpu": 128,\n    "environment": [{\n      "name": "SECRET",\n      "value": "KEY"\n    }],\n    "essential": true,\n    "image": "mongo:latest",\n    "memory": 128,\n    "memoryReservation": 64,\n    "name": "mongodb"\n  }\n]\n\n',
      family: "mongodb",
    });
    const dataAwsEcsTaskDefinitionMongo = new DataAwsEcsTaskDefinition(
      this,
      "mongo_2",
      {
        taskDefinition: mongo.family,
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    dataAwsEcsTaskDefinitionMongo.overrideLogicalId("mongo");
    const awsEcsServiceMongo = new EcsService(this, "mongo_3", {
      cluster: foo.id,
      desiredCount: 2,
      name: "mongo",
      taskDefinition: Token.asString(dataAwsEcsTaskDefinitionMongo.arn),
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsEcsServiceMongo.overrideLogicalId("mongo");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `taskDefinition` - (Required) Family for the latest ACTIVE revision, family and revision (family:revision) for a specific revision in the family, the ARN of the task definition to access to.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - ARN of the task definition.
* `arn` - ARN of the task definition.
* `arnWithoutRevision` - ARN of the Task Definition with the trailing `revision` removed. This may be useful for situations where the latest task definition is always desired. If a revision isn't specified, the latest ACTIVE revision is used. See the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_StartTask.html#ECS-StartTask-request-taskDefinition) for details.
* `executionRoleArn` - ARN of the task execution role that the Amazon ECS container agent and the Docker.
* `family` - Family of this task definition.
* `networkMode` - Docker networking mode to use for the containers in this task.
* `revision` - Revision of this task definition.
* `status` - Status of this task definition.
* `taskRoleArn` - ARN of the IAM role that containers in this task can assume.
