/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsVpnGateway } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-vpn-gateway";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const selected = new DataAwsVpnGateway(this, "selected", {
      filter: [
        {
          name: "tag:Name",
          values: ["vpn-gw"],
