# Data Source: aws_autoscaling_group

Use this data source to get information on an existing autoscaling group.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsAutoscalingGroup } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-autoscaling-group";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsAutoscalingGroup(this, "foo", {
      name: "foo",
    });
  }
}
