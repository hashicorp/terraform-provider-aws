import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";

 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsSfnStateMachine } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-sfn-state-machine";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsSfnStateMachine(this, "example", {
      name: "an_example_sfn_name",
    });
  }
}

```
