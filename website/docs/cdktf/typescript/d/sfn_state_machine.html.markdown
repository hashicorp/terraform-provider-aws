# Data Source: aws_sfn_state_machine

Use this data source to get the ARN of a State Machine in AWS Step
Function (SFN). By using this data source, you can reference a
state machine without having to hard code the ARNs as input.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsSfnStateMachine } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-sfn-state-machine";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsSfnStateMachine(this, "example", {
      name: "an_example_sfn_name",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `region` - (Optional) Region where this resource will be [managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints). Defaults to the Region set in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#aws-configuration-reference).
* `name` - (Required) Friendly name of the state machine to match.

## Attribute Reference

* `id` - Set to the ARN of the found state machine, suitable for referencing in other resources that support State Machines.
* `arn` - Set to the arn of the state function.
* `roleArn` - Set to the role_arn used by the state function.
* `definition` - Set to the state machine definition.
* `creationDate` - Date the state machine was created.
