# Data Source: aws_ec2_coip_pools

Provides information for multiple EC2 Customer-Owned IP Pools, such as their identifiers.

## Example Usage

The following shows outputting all COIP Pool Ids.

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformOutput, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsEc2CoipPools } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-ec2-coip-pools";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const foo = new DataAwsEc2CoipPools(this, "foo", {});
    const cdktfTerraformOutputFoo = new TerraformOutput(this, "foo_1", {
      value: foo.ids,
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    cdktfTerraformOutputFoo.overrideLogicalId("foo");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `region` - (Optional) Region where this resource will be [managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints). Defaults to the Region set in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#aws-configuration-reference).
* `tags` - (Optional) Mapping of tags, each pair of which must exactly match
  a pair on the desired aws_ec2_coip_pools.
* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.

More complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,
which take the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by
  [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeCoipPools.html).
* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field.
  A COIP Pool will be selected if any one of the given values matches.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - AWS Region.
* `poolIds` - Set of COIP Pool Identifiers

## Timeouts
