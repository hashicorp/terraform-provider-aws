To fetch the Resource, you must provide the REST API id as well as the full path.  

## Example Usage

```typescript

import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsApiGatewayResource } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-api-gateway-resource";
import { DataAwsApiGatewayRestApi } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-api-gateway-rest-api";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const myRestApi = new DataAwsApiGatewayRestApi(this, "my_rest_api", {
      name: "my-rest-api",
    });
    new DataAwsApiGatewayResource(this, "my_resource", {
      path: "/endpoint/path",
      restApiId: Token.asString(myRestApi.id),
