# Data Source: aws_api_gateway_vpc_link

Use this data source to get the id of a VPC Link in
API Gateway. To fetch the VPC Link you must provide a name to match against.
As there is no unique name constraint on API Gateway VPC Links this data source will
error if there is more than one match.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsApiGatewayVpcLink } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-api-gateway-vpc-link";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsApiGatewayVpcLink(this, "my_api_gateway_vpc_link", {
      name: "my-vpc-link",
    });
  }
}

```
