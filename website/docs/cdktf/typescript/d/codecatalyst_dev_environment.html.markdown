import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*

 */
import { DataAwsCodecatalystDevEnvironment } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-codecatalyst-dev-environment";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsCodecatalystDevEnvironment(this, "example", {
      envId: Token.asString(awsCodecatalystDevEnvironmentExample.id),
      projectName: "myproject",
      spaceName: "myspace",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `envId` - - (Required) The system-generated unique ID of the Dev Environment for which you want to view information. To retrieve a list of Dev Environment IDs, use [ListDevEnvironments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/APIReference/API_ListDevEnvironments.html).
