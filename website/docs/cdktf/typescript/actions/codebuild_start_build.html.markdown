# Action: aws_codebuild_start_build

~> **Note:** `aws_codebuild_start_build` is in beta. Its interface and behavior may change as the feature evolves, and breaking changes are possible. It is offered as a technical preview without compatibility guarantees until Terraform 1.14 is generally available.

Starts a CodeBuild project build. This action will initiate a build and wait for it to complete, providing progress updates during execution.

For information about AWS CodeBuild, see the [AWS CodeBuild User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/). For specific information about starting builds, see the [StartBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/APIReference/API_StartBuild.html) page in the AWS CodeBuild API Reference.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript

import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, DataResource, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { CodebuildProject } from "./.gen/providers/aws/codebuild-project";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new CodebuildProject(this, "example", {
      artifacts: {
        type: "NO_ARTIFACTS",
      },
      environment: {
        computeType: "BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL",

        type: "LINUX_CONTAINER",
      },
      name: "example-project",
      serviceRole: Token.asString(awsIamRoleExample.arn),
      source: {
        buildspec:
          "version: 0.2\nphases:\n  build:\n    commands:\n      - echo 'Hello World'\n",

      },
    });
    new DataResource(this, "build_trigger", {
      input: "trigger-build",
      lifecycle: {
        actionTrigger: [
          {
            actions: [awsCodebuildStartBuild.example],
