# Action: aws_lambda_invoke

~> **Note:** `aws_lambda_invoke` is in beta. Its interface and behavior may change as the feature evolves, and breaking changes are possible. It is offered as a technical preview without compatibility guarantees until Terraform 1.14 is generally available.

Invokes an AWS Lambda function with the specified payload. This action allows for imperative invocation of Lambda functions with full control over invocation parameters.

For information about AWS Lambda functions, see the [AWS Lambda Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/). For specific information about invoking Lambda functions, see the [Invoke](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/api/API_Invoke.html) page in the AWS Lambda API Reference.

~> **Note:** Synchronous invocations will wait for the function to complete execution, while asynchronous invocations return immediately after the request is _accepted_.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { DataResource, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { LambdaFunction } from "./.gen/providers/aws/lambda-function";
interface MyConfig {
  functionName: any;
  role: any;
}
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string, config: MyConfig) {
    super(scope, name);
    new LambdaFunction(this, "example", {
      functionName: config.functionName,
      role: config.role,
    });
    const terraformDataExample = new DataResource(this, "example_1", {
      input: "trigger-lambda",
      lifecycle: {
        actionTrigger: [
          {
            actions: [awsLambdaInvoke.example],
            events: [beforeCreate, beforeUpdate],
          },
        ],
      },
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    terraformDataExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

### Invoke with Function Version

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

### Asynchronous Invocation

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

### Dry Run Validation

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

### With Log Capture

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

### Mobile Application Context

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

Use this action in your deployment pipeline to trigger post-deployment functions:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { DataResource, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataResource(this, "deploy_complete", {
      dependsOn: [api],
      input: deploymentId,
      lifecycle: {
        actionTrigger: [
          {
            actions: [awsLambdaInvoke.warmup],
            events: [beforeCreate, beforeUpdate],
          },
        ],
      },
    });
  }
}

```

### Environment-Specific Processing

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

### Complex Payload with Dynamic Content

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This action supports the following arguments:

* `clientContext` - (Optional) Up to 3,583 bytes of base64-encoded data about the invoking client to pass to the function in the context object. This is only used for mobile applications and should contain information about the client application and device.
* `functionName` - (Required) Name, ARN, or partial ARN of the Lambda function to invoke. You can specify a function name (e.g., `my-function`), a qualified function name (e.g., `my-function:PROD`), or a partial ARN (e.g., `123456789012:function:my-function`).
* `invocationType` - (Optional) Invocation type. Valid values are `RequestResponse` (default) for synchronous invocation that waits for the function to complete and returns the response, `Event` for asynchronous invocation that returns immediately after the request is accepted, and `DryRun` to validate parameters and verify permissions without actually executing the function.
* `logType` - (Optional) Set to `Tail` to include the execution log in the response. Only applies to synchronous invocations (`RequestResponse` invocation type). Defaults to `None`. When set to `Tail`, the last 4 KB of the execution log is included in the response.
* `payload` - (Required) JSON payload to send to the Lambda function. This should be a valid JSON string that represents the event data for your function. The payload size limit is 6 MB for synchronous invocations and 256 KB for asynchronous invocations.
* `qualifier` - (Optional) Version or alias of the Lambda function to invoke. If not specified, the `$LATEST` version will be invoked. Can be a version number (e.g., `1`) or an alias (e.g., `PROD`).
