# Action: aws_ses_send_email

~> **Note:** `aws_ses_send_email` is in beta. Its interface and behavior may change as the feature evolves, and breaking changes are possible. It is offered as a technical preview without compatibility guarantees until Terraform 1.14 is generally available.

Sends an email using Amazon SES. This action allows for imperative email sending with full control over recipients, content, and formatting.

For information about Amazon SES, see the [Amazon SES Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/). For specific information about sending emails, see the [SendEmail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/APIReference/API_SendEmail.html) page in the Amazon SES API Reference.

~> **Note:** All email addresses used must be verified in Amazon SES or belong to a verified domain. Due to the difficulty in testing, your help is important in discovering and reporting issues.

### Basic Usage

```typescript

import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { DataResource, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { SesEmailIdentity } from "./.gen/providers/aws/ses-email-identity";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new SesEmailIdentity(this, "example", {
      email: "sender@example.com",
    });
    const terraformDataExample = new DataResource(this, "example_1", {

## Argument Reference

This action supports the following arguments:

* `bcc_addresses` - (Optional) List of email addresses for the BCC: field of the message. Recipients in this list will receive the email but their addresses will not be visible to other recipients.
* `cc_addresses` - (Optional) List of email addresses for the CC: field of the message. Recipients in this list will receive the email and their addresses will be visible to all recipients.

* `return_path` - (Optional) Email address that bounces and complaints will be forwarded to when feedback forwarding is enabled. This is useful for handling delivery failures and spam complaints.
* `source` - (Required) Email address that is sending the email. This address must be either individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES.
* `subject` - (Required) Subject of the message: A short summary of the content, which will appear in the recipient's inbox.
