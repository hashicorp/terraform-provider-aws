# List Resource: aws_iam_role

~> **Note:** The `aws_iam_role` List Resource is in beta. Its interface and behavior may change as the feature evolves, and breaking changes are possible. It is offered as a technical preview without compatibility guarantees until Terraform 1.14 is generally available.

Excludes Service-Linked Roles (see "AWS service-linked role" in [IAM Roles Terms and Concepts documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html#id_roles_terms-and-concepts)).

import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```
