# List Resource: aws_instance

~> **Note:** The `aws_instance` List Resource is in beta. Its interface and behavior may change as the feature evolves, and breaking changes are possible. It is offered as a technical preview without compatibility guarantees until Terraform 1.14 is generally available.

Lists EC2 Instance resources.

By default, EC2 Instances managed by an Auto Scaling Group and EC2 Instances in either the `terminated` or `shutting-down` state are excluded.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

### Filter Usage

This example will return instances in the `stopped` state.

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```
