# Resource: aws_vpc_endpoint_service_private_dns_verification

Terraform resource for managing an AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) Endpoint Service Private DNS Verification.
This resource begins the verification process by calling the [`StartVpcEndpointServicePrivateDnsVerification`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_StartVpcEndpointServicePrivateDnsVerification.html) API.
The service provider should add a record to the DNS server _before_ creating this resource.

For additional details, refer to the AWS documentation on [managing VPC endpoint service DNS names](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/manage-dns-names.html).

~> Destruction of this resource will not stop the verification process, only remove the resource from state.
