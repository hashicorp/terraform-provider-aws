# Resource: aws_detective_invitation_accepter

Provides a resource to manage an [Amazon Detective Invitation Accepter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/APIReference/API_AcceptInvitation.html). Ensure that the accepter is configured to use the AWS account you wish to _accept_ the invitation from the primary graph owner account.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.detective_graph import DetectiveGraph
from imports.aws.detective_invitation_accepter import DetectiveInvitationAccepter
from imports.aws.detective_member import DetectiveMember
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        primary = DetectiveGraph(self, "primary")
        aws_detective_member_primary = DetectiveMember(self, "primary_1",
            account_id="ACCOUNT ID",
            email_address="EMAIL",
            graph_arn=primary.id,
            message="Message of the invite"
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_detective_member_primary.override_logical_id("primary")
        DetectiveInvitationAccepter(self, "member",
            depends_on=[aws_detective_member_primary],
            graph_arn=primary.graph_arn,
            provider="awsalternate"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `graph_arn` - (Required) ARN of the behavior graph that the member account is accepting the invitation for.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - Unique identifier (ID) of the Detective invitation accepter.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_detective_invitation_accepter` using the graph ARN. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_detective_invitation_accepter` using the graph ARN. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_detective_invitation_accepter.example arn:aws:detective:us-east-1:123456789101:graph:231684d34gh74g4bae1dbc7bd807d02d
```
