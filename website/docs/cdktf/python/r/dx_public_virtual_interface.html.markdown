# Resource: aws_dx_public_virtual_interface

Provides a Direct Connect public virtual interface resource.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.dx_public_virtual_interface import DxPublicVirtualInterface
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DxPublicVirtualInterface(self, "foo",
            address_family="ipv4",
            amazon_address="175.45.176.2/30",
            bgp_asn=65352,
            connection_id="dxcon-zzzzzzzz",
            customer_address="175.45.176.1/30",
            name="vif-foo",
            route_filter_prefixes=["210.52.109.0/24", "175.45.176.0/22"],
            vlan=4094
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `address_family` - (Required) The address family for the BGP peer. `ipv4 ` or `ipv6`.
* `bgp_asn` - (Required) The autonomous system (AS) number for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) configuration.
* `connection_id` - (Required) The ID of the Direct Connect connection (or LAG) on which to create the virtual interface.
* `name` - (Required) The name for the virtual interface.
* `vlan` - (Required) The VLAN ID.
* `amazon_address` - (Optional) The IPv4 CIDR address to use to send traffic to Amazon. Required for IPv4 BGP peers.
* `bgp_auth_key` - (Optional) The authentication key for BGP configuration.
* `customer_address` - (Optional) The IPv4 CIDR destination address to which Amazon should send traffic. Required for IPv4 BGP peers.
* `route_filter_prefixes` - (Required) A list of routes to be advertised to the AWS network in this region.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The ID of the virtual interface.
* `arn` - The ARN of the virtual interface.
* `aws_device` - The Direct Connect endpoint on which the virtual interface terminates.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

- `create` - (Default `10m`)
- `delete` - (Default `10m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Direct Connect public virtual interfaces using the VIF `id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Using `terraform import`, import Direct Connect public virtual interfaces using the VIF `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_dx_public_virtual_interface.test dxvif-33cc44dd
```
