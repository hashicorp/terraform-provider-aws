## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Amazon Connect Hours of Operations using the `instance_id` and `hours_of_operation_id` separated by a colon (`:`). For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Using `terraform import`, import Amazon Connect Hours of Operations using the `instance_id` and `hours_of_operation_id` separated by a colon (`:`). For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_connect_hours_of_operation.example f1288a1f-6193-445a-b47e-af739b2:c1d4e5f6-1b3c-1b3c-1b3c-c1d4e5f6c1d4e5
