# Resource: aws_dx_gateway_association

Associates a Direct Connect Gateway with a VGW or transit gateway.

To create a cross-account association, create an [`aws_dx_gateway_association_proposal` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/dx_gateway_association_proposal.html)
in the AWS account that owns the VGW or transit gateway and then accept the proposal in the AWS account that owns the Direct Connect Gateway
by creating an `aws_dx_gateway_association` resource with the `proposal_id` and `associated_gateway_owner_account_id` attributes set.

## Example Usage

### VPN Gateway Association

A full example of how to create a VPN Gateway in one AWS account, create a Direct Connect Gateway in a second AWS account, and associate the VPN Gateway with the Direct Connect Gateway via the `aws_dx_gateway_association_proposal` and `aws_dx_gateway_association` resources can be found in [the `./examples/dx-gateway-cross-account-vgw-association` directory within the Github Repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/tree/main/examples/dx-gateway-cross-account-vgw-association).

## Argument Reference

~> **NOTE:** `dx_gateway_id` and `associated_gateway_id` must be specified for single account Direct Connect gateway associations.

This argument supports the following arguments:

* `dx_gateway_id` - (Required) The ID of the Direct Connect gateway.
* `associated_gateway_id` - (Optional) The ID of the VGW or transit gateway with which to associate the Direct Connect gateway.
Used for single account Direct Connect gateway associations.
* `associated_gateway_owner_account_id` - (Optional) The ID of the AWS account that owns the VGW or transit gateway with which to associate the Direct Connect gateway.
Used for cross-account Direct Connect gateway associations.
* `proposal_id` - (Optional) The ID of the Direct Connect gateway association proposal.
Used for cross-account Direct Connect gateway associations.
* `allowed_prefixes` - (Optional) VPC prefixes (CIDRs) to advertise to the Direct Connect gateway. Defaults to the CIDR block of the VPC associated with the Virtual Gateway. To enable drift detection, must be configured.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The ID of the Direct Connect gateway association resource.
* `associated_gateway_type` - The type of the associated gateway, `transitGateway` or `virtualPrivateGateway`.
* `dx_gateway_association_id` - The ID of the Direct Connect gateway association.
* `dx_gateway_owner_account_id` - The ID of the AWS account that owns the Direct Connect gateway.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

- `create` - (Default `30m`)
- `update` - (Default `30m`)
- `delete` - (Default `30m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Direct Connect gateway associations using `dx_gateway_id` together with `associated_gateway_id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Using `terraform import`, import Direct Connect gateway associations using `dx_gateway_id` together with `associated_gateway_id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_dx_gateway_association.example 345508c3-7215-4aef-9832-07c125d5bd0f/vgw-98765432
```
