Manages a directory in your account (directory owner) shared with another account (directory consumer).

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Fn, Token, TerraformStack

from imports.aws.directory_service_directory import DirectoryServiceDirectory
from imports.aws.directory_service_shared_directory import DirectoryServiceSharedDirectory
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = DirectoryServiceDirectory(self, "example",
            edition="Standard",
            name="tf-example",
            password="SuperSecretPassw0rd",
            type="MicrosoftAD",
            vpc_settings=DirectoryServiceDirectoryVpcSettings(
                subnet_ids=Token.as_list(Fn.lookup_nested(aws_subnet_example, ["*", "id"])),
                vpc_id=Token.as_string(aws_vpc_example.id)
            )
        )
        aws_directory_service_shared_directory_example =
        DirectoryServiceSharedDirectory(self, "example_1",
            directory_id=example.id,
            notes="You wanna have a catch?",
            target=DirectoryServiceSharedDirectoryTarget(
                id=Token.as_string(receiver.account_id)
            )
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_directory_service_shared_directory_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `directory_id` - (Required) Identifier of the Managed Microsoft AD directory that you want to share with other accounts.
* `target` - (Required) Identifier for the directory consumer account with whom the directory is to be shared. See below.

The following arguments are optional:

* `method` - (Optional) Method used when sharing a directory. Valid values are `ORGANIZATIONS` and `HANDSHAKE`. Default is `HANDSHAKE`.
* `notes` - (Optional, Sensitive) Message sent by the directory owner to the directory consumer to help the directory consumer administrator determine whether to approve or reject the share invitation.

### `target`

* `type` - (Optional) Type of identifier to be used in the `id` field. Valid value is `ACCOUNT`. Default is `ACCOUNT`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - Identifier of the shared directory.
* `shared_directory_id` - Identifier of the directory that is stored in the directory consumer account that corresponds to the shared directory in the owner account.

## Timeouts

`aws_directory_service_shared_directory` provides the following [Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) configuration options:

- `delete` - (Default `60 minutes`) Used for shared directory deletion

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Directory Service Shared Directories using the owner directory ID/shared directory ID. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Using `terraform import`, import Directory Service Shared Directories using the owner directory ID/shared directory ID. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_directory_service_shared_directory.example d-1234567890/d-9267633ece
```
