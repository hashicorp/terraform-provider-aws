# Resource: aws_lightsail_lb_certificate

Creates a Lightsail load balancer Certificate resource.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.lightsail_lb import LightsailLb
from imports.aws.lightsail_lb_certificate import LightsailLbCertificate
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        test = LightsailLb(self, "test",
            health_check_path="/",
            instance_port=Token.as_number("80"),
            name="test-load-balancer",
            tags={
                "foo": "bar"
            }
        )
        aws_lightsail_lb_certificate_test = LightsailLbCertificate(self, "test_1",
            domain_name="test.com",
            lb_name=test.id,
            name="test-load-balancer-certificate"
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_lightsail_lb_certificate_test.override_logical_id("test")
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `domain_name` - (Required) The domain name (e.g., example.com) for your SSL/TLS certificate.
* `lb_name` - (Required) The load balancer name where you want to create the SSL/TLS certificate.
* `name` - (Required) The SSL/TLS certificate name.
* `name` - (Required) The SSL/TLS certificate name.
* `subject_alternative_names` - (Optional) Set of domains that should be SANs in the issued certificate. `domain_name` attribute is automatically added as a Subject Alternative Name.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - A combination of attributes to create a unique id: `lb_name`,`name`
* `arn` - The ARN of the lightsail certificate.
* `created_at` - The timestamp when the instance was created.
* `domain_validation_options` - Set of domain validation objects which can be used to complete certificate validation. Can have more than one element, e.g., if SANs are defined.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_lightsail_lb_certificate` using the id attribute. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.lightsail_lb_certificate import LightsailLbCertificate
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        LightsailLbCertificate.generate_config_for_import(self, "test", "example-load-balancer,example-load-balancer-certificate")
```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_lightsail_lb_certificate` using the id attribute. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_lightsail_lb_certificate.test example-load-balancer,example-load-balancer-certificate
```
