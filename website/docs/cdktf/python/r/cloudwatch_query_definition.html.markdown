Provides a CloudWatch Logs query definition resource.

## Example Usage

# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.cloudwatch_query_definition import CloudwatchQueryDefinition
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CloudwatchQueryDefinition(self, "example",
            log_group_names=["/aws/logGroup1", "/aws/logGroup2"],
            name="custom_query",
            query_string="fields @timestamp, @message\n| sort @timestamp desc\n| limit 25\n\n"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the query.
* `query_string` - (Required) The query to save. You can read more about CloudWatch Logs Query Syntax in the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_QuerySyntax.html).
* `log_group_names` - (Optional) Specific log groups to use with the query.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `query_definition_id` - The query definition ID.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import CloudWatch query definitions using the query definition ARN. The ARN can be found on the "Edit Query" page for the query in the AWS Console. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Using `terraform import`, import CloudWatch query definitions using the query definition ARN. The ARN can be found on the "Edit Query" page for the query in the AWS Console. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_cloudwatch_query_definition.example arn:aws:logs:us-west-2:123456789012:query-definition:269951d7-6f75-496d-9d7b-6b7a5486bdbd
```
