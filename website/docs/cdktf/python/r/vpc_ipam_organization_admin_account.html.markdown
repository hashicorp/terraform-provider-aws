        )
        delegated = DataAwsCallerIdentity(self, "delegated",
            provider=ipam_delegate_account
        )
        VpcIpamOrganizationAdminAccount(self, "example",

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import IPAMs using the delegate account `id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.vpc_ipam_organization_admin_account import VpcIpamOrganizationAdminAccount
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        VpcIpamOrganizationAdminAccount.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "12345678901")
```

Using `terraform import`, import IPAMs using the delegate account `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_vpc_ipam_organization_admin_account.example 12345678901
```
