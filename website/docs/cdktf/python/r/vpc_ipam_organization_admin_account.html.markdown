from imports.aws.data_aws_caller_identity import DataAwsCallerIdentity
from imports.aws.provider import AwsProvider
from imports.aws.vpc_ipam_organization_admin_account import VpcIpamOrganizationAdminAccount
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        ipam_delegate_account = AwsProvider(self, "aws",
            alias="ipam_delegate_account"
        )
        delegated = DataAwsCallerIdentity(self, "delegated",
            provider=ipam_delegate_account
        )
        VpcIpamOrganizationAdminAccount(self, "example",
            delegated_admin_account_id=Token.as_string(delegated.account_id)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import IPAMs using the delegate account `id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Using `terraform import`, import IPAMs using the delegate account `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_vpc_ipam_organization_admin_account.example 12345678901
```
