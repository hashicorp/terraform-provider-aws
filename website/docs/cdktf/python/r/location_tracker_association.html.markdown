# Resource: aws_location_tracker_association

Terraform resource for managing an AWS Location Tracker Association.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.location_geofence_collection import LocationGeofenceCollection
from imports.aws.location_tracker import LocationTracker
from imports.aws.location_tracker_association import LocationTrackerAssociation
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = LocationGeofenceCollection(self, "example",
            collection_name="example"
        )
        aws_location_tracker_example = LocationTracker(self, "example_1",
            tracker_name="example"
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_location_tracker_example.override_logical_id("example")
        aws_location_tracker_association_example = LocationTrackerAssociation(self, "example_2",
            consumer_arn=example.collection_arn,
            tracker_name=Token.as_string(aws_location_tracker_example.tracker_name)
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_location_tracker_association_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `consumer_arn` - (Required) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the geofence collection to be associated to tracker resource. Used when you need to specify a resource across all AWS.
* `tracker_name` - (Required) The name of the tracker resource to be associated with a geofence collection.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports no additional attributes.

## Timeouts

`aws_location_tracker_association` provides the following [Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) configuration options:

* `create` - (Optional, Default: `30m`)
* `delete` - (Optional, Default: `30m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Location Tracker Association using the `tracker_name|consumer_arn`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.location_tracker_association import LocationTrackerAssociation
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        LocationTrackerAssociation.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "tracker_name|consumer_arn")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Location Tracker Association using the `tracker_name|consumer_arn`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_location_tracker_association.example "tracker_name|consumer_arn"
```
