# Resource: aws_iam_group

Provides an IAM group.

~> **NOTE on user management:** Using `aws_iam_group_membership` or `aws_iam_user_group_membership` resources in addition to manually managing user/group membership using the console may lead to configuration drift or conflicts. For this reason, it's recommended to either manage membership entirely with Terraform or entirely within the AWS console.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.iam_group import IamGroup
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        IamGroup(self, "developers",
            name="developers",
            path="/users/"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) The group's name. The name must consist of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: `=,.@-_.`. Group names are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot create groups named both "ADMINS" and "admins".
* `path` - (Optional, default "/") Path in which to create the group.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The group's name.
* `arn` - The ARN assigned by AWS for this group.
* `name` - The group's name.
* `path` - The path of the group in IAM.
* `unique_id` - The [unique ID][1] assigned by AWS.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import IAM Groups using the `name`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Using `terraform import`, import IAM Groups using the `name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_iam_group.developers developers
```
