* `id` - ID of traffic policy instance.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Route53 traffic policy instance using its id. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.route53_traffic_policy_instance import Route53TrafficPolicyInstance
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        Route53TrafficPolicyInstance.generate_config_for_import(self, "test", "df579d9a-6396-410e-ac22-e7ad60cf9e7e")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Route53 traffic policy instance using its id. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_route53_traffic_policy_instance.test df579d9a-6396-410e-ac22-e7ad60cf9e7e
```
