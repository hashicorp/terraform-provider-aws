# Resource: aws_prometheus_alert_manager_definition

Manages an Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP) Alert Manager Definition

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.prometheus_alert_manager_definition import PrometheusAlertManagerDefinition
from imports.aws.prometheus_workspace import PrometheusWorkspace
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        demo = PrometheusWorkspace(self, "demo")
        aws_prometheus_alert_manager_definition_demo =
        PrometheusAlertManagerDefinition(self, "demo_1",
            definition="alertmanager_config: |\n  route:\n    receiver: 'default'\n  receivers:\n    - name: 'default'\n\n",
            workspace_id=demo.id
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_prometheus_alert_manager_definition_demo.override_logical_id("demo")
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `workspace_id` - (Required) ID of the prometheus workspace the alert manager definition should be linked to
* `definition` - (Required) the alert manager definition that you want to be applied. See more [in AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/AMP-alert-manager.html).

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports no additional attributes.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import the prometheus alert manager definition using the workspace identifier. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.prometheus_alert_manager_definition import PrometheusAlertManagerDefinition
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        PrometheusAlertManagerDefinition.generate_config_for_import(self, "demo", "ws-C6DCB907-F2D7-4D96-957B-66691F865D8B")
```

Using `terraform import`, import the prometheus alert manager definition using the workspace identifier. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_prometheus_alert_manager_definition.demo ws-C6DCB907-F2D7-4D96-957B-66691F865D8B
```
