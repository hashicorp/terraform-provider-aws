# Resource: aws_cloudwatch_log_delivery

Terraform resource for managing an AWS CloudWatch Logs Delivery. A delivery is a connection between an `aws_cloudwatch_log_delivery_source` and an `aws_cloudwatch_log_delivery_destination`.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.cloudwatch_log_delivery import CloudwatchLogDelivery
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CloudwatchLogDelivery(self, "example",
            delivery_destination_arn=Token.as_string(aws_cloudwatch_log_delivery_destination_example.arn),
            delivery_source_name=Token.as_string(aws_cloudwatch_log_delivery_source_example.name),
            field_delimiter=",",
            record_fields=["event_timestamp", "event"]
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `delivery_destination_arn` - (Required) The ARN of the delivery destination to use for this delivery.
* `delivery_source_name` - (Required) The name of the delivery source to use for this delivery.
* `field_delimiter` - (Optional) The field delimiter to use between record fields when the final output format of a delivery is in `plain`, `w3c`, or `raw` format.
* `record_fields` - (Optional) The list of record fields to be delivered to the destination, in order.
* `s3_delivery_configuration` - (Optional) Parameters that are valid only when the delivery's delivery destination is an S3 bucket.
    * `enable_hive_compatible_path` - (Optional) This parameter causes the S3 objects that contain delivered logs to use a prefix structure that allows for integration with Apache Hive.
    * `suffix_path` - (Optional) This string allows re-configuring the S3 object prefix to contain either static or variable sections. The valid variables to use in the suffix path will vary by each log source.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the delivery.
* `id` - The unique ID that identifies this delivery in your account.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import CloudWatch Logs Delivery using the `id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.cloudwatch_log_delivery import CloudwatchLogDelivery
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CloudwatchLogDelivery.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "jsoGVi4Zq8VlYp9n")
```

Using `terraform import`, import CloudWatch Logs Delivery using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_cloudwatch_log_delivery.example jsoGVi4Zq8VlYp9n
```
