# Resource: aws_acmpca_certificate_authority

Provides a resource to manage AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authorities (ACM PCA Certificate Authorities).

~> **NOTE:** Creating this resource will leave the certificate authority in a `PENDING_CERTIFICATE` status, which means it cannot yet issue certificates. To complete this setup, you must fully sign the certificate authority CSR available in the `certificate_signing_request` attribute. The [`aws_acmpca_certificate_authority_certificate`](/docs/providers/aws/r/acmpca_certificate_authority_certificate.html) resource can be used for this purpose.

## Example Usage

### Basic

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.acmpca_certificate_authority import AcmpcaCertificateAuthority
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        AcmpcaCertificateAuthority(self, "example",
            certificate_authority_configuration=AcmpcaCertificateAuthorityCertificateAuthorityConfiguration(
                key_algorithm="RSA_4096",
                signing_algorithm="SHA512WITHRSA",
                subject=AcmpcaCertificateAuthorityCertificateAuthorityConfigurationSubject(
                    common_name="example.com"
                )
            ),
            permanent_deletion_time_in_days=7
        )
```

### Short-lived certificate

```python

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `certificate_authority_configuration` - (Required) Nested argument containing algorithms and certificate subject information. Defined below.
* `enabled` - (Optional) Whether the certificate authority is enabled or disabled. Defaults to `true`. Can only be disabled if the CA is in an `ACTIVE` state.
* `revocation_configuration` - (Optional) Nested argument containing revocation configuration. Defined below.
* `usage_mode` - (Optional) Specifies whether the CA issues general-purpose certificates that typically require a revocation mechanism, or short-lived certificates that may optionally omit revocation because they expire quickly. Short-lived certificate validity is limited to seven days. Defaults to `GENERAL_PURPOSE`. Valid values: `GENERAL_PURPOSE` and `SHORT_LIVED_CERTIFICATE`.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of user-defined tags that are attached to the certificate authority. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `type` - (Optional) Type of the certificate authority. Defaults to `SUBORDINATE`. Valid values: `ROOT` and `SUBORDINATE`.

the custom OCSP responder endpoint. Defined below.

#### crl_configuration

* `custom_cname` - (Optional) Name inserted into the certificate CRL Distribution Points extension that enables the use of an alias for the CRL distribution point. Use this value if you don't want the name of your S3 bucket to be public. Must be less than or equal to 253 characters in length.
* `enabled` - (Optional) Boolean value that specifies whether certificate revocation lists (CRLs) are enabled. Defaults to `false`.
* `expiration_in_days` - (Optional, Required if `enabled` is `true`) Number of days until a certificate expires. Must be between 1 and 5000.
* `s3_bucket_name` - (Optional, Required if `enabled` is `true`) Name of the S3 bucket that contains the CRL. If you do not provide a value for the `custom_cname` argument, the name of your S3 bucket is placed into the CRL Distribution Points extension of the issued certificate. You must specify a bucket policy that allows ACM PCA to write the CRL to your bucket. Must be between 3 and 255 characters in length.
* `s3_object_acl` - (Optional) Determines whether the CRL will be publicly readable or privately held in the CRL Amazon S3 bucket. Defaults to `PUBLIC_READ`.

#### ocsp_configuration

* `enabled` - (Required) Boolean value that specifies whether a custom OCSP responder is enabled.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - ARN of the certificate authority.
* `arn` - ARN of the certificate authority.
* `certificate` - Base64-encoded certificate authority (CA) certificate. Only available after the certificate authority certificate has been imported.
* `certificate_chain` - Base64-encoded certificate chain that includes any intermediate certificates and chains up to root on-premises certificate that you used to sign your private CA certificate. The chain does not include your private CA certificate. Only available after the certificate authority certificate has been imported.

* `create` - (Default `1m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_acmpca_certificate_authority` using the certificate authority ARN. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.acmpca_certificate_authority import AcmpcaCertificateAuthority
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        AcmpcaCertificateAuthority.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "arn:aws:acm-pca:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012")
```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_acmpca_certificate_authority` using the certificate authority ARN. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_acmpca_certificate_authority.example arn:aws:acm-pca:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
```
