# Resource: aws_ses_identity_notification_topic

Resource for managing SES Identity Notification Topics

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.ses_identity_notification_topic import SesIdentityNotificationTopic
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        SesIdentityNotificationTopic(self, "test",
            identity=example.domain,
            include_original_headers=True,
            notification_type="Bounce",
            topic_arn=Token.as_string(aws_sns_topic_example.arn)
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `topic_arn` - (Optional) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic. Can be set to `""` (an empty string) to disable publishing.
* `notification_type` - (Required) The type of notifications that will be published to the specified Amazon SNS topic. Valid Values: `Bounce`, `Complaint` or `Delivery`.
* `identity` - (Required) The identity for which the Amazon SNS topic will be set. You can specify an identity by using its name or by using its Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
* `include_original_headers` - (Optional) Whether SES should include original email headers in SNS notifications of this type. `false` by default.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports no additional attributes.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Identity Notification Topics using the ID of the record. The ID is made up as `IDENTITY|TYPE` where `IDENTITY` is the SES Identity and `TYPE` is the Notification Type. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.ses_identity_notification_topic import SesIdentityNotificationTopic
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        SesIdentityNotificationTopic.generate_config_for_import(self, "test", "example.com|Bounce")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Identity Notification Topics using the ID of the record. The ID is made up as `IDENTITY|TYPE` where `IDENTITY` is the SES Identity and `TYPE` is the Notification Type. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_ses_identity_notification_topic.test 'example.com|Bounce'
```
