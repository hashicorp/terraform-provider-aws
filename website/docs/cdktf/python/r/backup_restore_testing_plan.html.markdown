from imports.aws.backup_restore_testing_plan import BackupRestoreTestingPlan
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name, *, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        BackupRestoreTestingPlan(self, "example",
            recovery_point_selection=[BackupRestoreTestingPlanRecoveryPointSelection(
                algorithm="LATEST_WITHIN_WINDOW",
                include_vaults=["*"],
                recovery_point_types=["CONTINUOUS"]
            )
            ],
            schedule_expression="cron(0 12 ? * * *)",
            name=name

### RecoveryPointSelection

* `algorithm` (Required): Specifies the algorithm used for selecting recovery points. Valid values are "RANDOM_WITHIN_WINDOW" and "LATEST_WITHIN_WINDOW".
* `include_vaults` (Required): Specifies the backup vaults to include in the recovery point selection. Each value must be a valid AWS ARN for a backup vault or "*" to include all backup vaults.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - ARN of the Restore Testing Plan.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Backup Restore Testing Plan using the `name`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.backup_restore_testing_plan import BackupRestoreTestingPlan
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        BackupRestoreTestingPlan.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "my_testing_plan")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Backup Restore Testing Plan using the `name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_backup_restore_testing_plan.example my_testing_plan
```
