# Resource: aws_nat_gateway_eip_association

Terraform resource for managing an AWS VPC NAT Gateway EIP Association.

!> **WARNING:** You should not use the `aws_nat_gateway_eip_association` resource in conjunction with an [`aws_nat_gateway`](aws_nat_gateway.html) resource that has `secondary_allocation_ids` configured. Doing so may cause perpetual differences, and result in associations being overwritten.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws. import NatGatewayEipAssociation
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        NatGatewayEipAssociation(self, "example",
            allocation_id=aws_eip_example.id,
            nat_gateway_id=aws_nat_gateway_example.id
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `allocation_id` - (Required) The ID of the Elastic IP Allocation to associate with the NAT Gateway.
* `nat_gateway_id` - (Required) The ID of the NAT Gateway to associate the Elastic IP Allocation to.

The following arguments are optional:

* `region` - (Optional) Region where this resource will be [managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints). Defaults to the Region set in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#aws-configuration-reference).

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports no additional attributes.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `create` - (Default `10m`)
* `delete` - (Default `30m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import VPC NAT Gateway EIP Association using the `nat_gateway_id,allocation_id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws. import NatGatewayEipAssociation
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        NatGatewayEipAssociation.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "nat-1234567890abcdef1,eipalloc-1234567890abcdef1")
```

Using `terraform import`, import VPC NAT Gateway EIP Association using the `nat_gateway_id,allocation_id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_nat_gateway_eip_association.example nat-1234567890abcdef1,eipalloc-1234567890abcdef1
```
