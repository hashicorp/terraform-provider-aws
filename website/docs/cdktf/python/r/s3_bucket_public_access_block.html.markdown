# Resource: aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block

Manages S3 bucket-level Public Access Block configuration. For more information about these settings, see the [AWS S3 Block Public Access documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html).

-> This resource cannot be used with S3 directory buckets.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.s3_bucket import S3Bucket
from imports.aws.s3_bucket_public_access_block import S3BucketPublicAccessBlock
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = S3Bucket(self, "example",
            bucket="example"
        )
        aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block_example = S3BucketPublicAccessBlock(self, "example_1",
            block_public_acls=True,
            block_public_policy=True,
            bucket=example.id,
            ignore_public_acls=True,
            restrict_public_buckets=True
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `bucket` - (Required) S3 Bucket to which this Public Access Block configuration should be applied.
* `block_public_acls` - (Optional) Whether Amazon S3 should block public ACLs for this bucket. Defaults to `false`. Enabling this setting does not affect existing policies or ACLs. When set to `true` causes the following behavior:
    * PUT Bucket acl and PUT Object acl calls will fail if the specified ACL allows public access.
    * PUT Object calls will fail if the request includes an object ACL.
* `block_public_policy` - (Optional) Whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket policies for this bucket. Defaults to `false`. Enabling this setting does not affect the existing bucket policy. When set to `true` causes Amazon S3 to:
    * Reject calls to PUT Bucket policy if the specified bucket policy allows public access.
* `ignore_public_acls` - (Optional) Whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for this bucket. Defaults to `false`. Enabling this setting does not affect the persistence of any existing ACLs and doesn't prevent new public ACLs from being set. When set to `true` causes Amazon S3 to:
    * Ignore public ACLs on this bucket and any objects that it contains.
* `restrict_public_buckets` - (Optional) Whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket policies for this bucket. Defaults to `false`. Enabling this setting does not affect the previously stored bucket policy, except that public and cross-account access within the public bucket policy, including non-public delegation to specific accounts, is blocked. When set to `true`:
    * Only the bucket owner and AWS Services can access this buckets if it has a public policy.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - Name of the S3 bucket the configuration is attached to

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block` using the bucket name. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.s3_bucket_public_access_block import S3BucketPublicAccessBlock
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        S3BucketPublicAccessBlock.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "my-bucket")
```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block` using the bucket name. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block.example my-bucket
```
