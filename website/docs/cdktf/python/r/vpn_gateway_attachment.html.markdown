# Resource: aws_vpn_gateway_attachment

Provides a Virtual Private Gateway attachment resource, allowing for an existing
hardware VPN gateway to be attached and/or detached from a VPC.

-> **Note:** The [`aws_vpn_gateway`](vpn_gateway.html)
resource can also automatically attach the Virtual Private Gateway it creates
to an existing VPC by setting the [`vpc_id`](vpn_gateway.html#vpc_id) attribute accordingly.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
