# Resource: aws_cloudwatch_log_destination

Provides a CloudWatch Logs destination resource.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.cloudwatch_log_destination import CloudwatchLogDestination
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CloudwatchLogDestination(self, "test_destination",
            name="test_destination",
            role_arn=iam_for_cloudwatch.arn,
            target_arn=kinesis_for_cloudwatch.arn
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) A name for the log destination.
* `role_arn` - (Required) The ARN of an IAM role that grants Amazon CloudWatch Logs permissions to put data into the target.
* `target_arn` - (Required) The ARN of the target Amazon Kinesis stream resource for the destination.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) specifying the log destination.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import CloudWatch Logs destinations using the `name`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.cloudwatch_log_destination import CloudwatchLogDestination
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CloudwatchLogDestination.generate_config_for_import(self, "testDestination", "test_destination")
```

Using `terraform import`, import CloudWatch Logs destinations using the `name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_cloudwatch_log_destination.test_destination test_destination
```
