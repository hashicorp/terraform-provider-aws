# Resource: aws_network_acl_association

Provides an network ACL association resource which allows you to associate your network ACL with any subnet(s).

~> **NOTE on Network ACLs and Network ACL Associations:** Terraform provides both a standalone network ACL association resource
and a [network ACL](network_acl.html) resource with a `subnet_ids` attribute. Do not use the same subnet ID in both a network ACL
resource and a network ACL association resource. Doing so will cause a conflict of associations and will overwrite the association.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.network_acl_association import NetworkAclAssociation
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        NetworkAclAssociation(self, "main",
            network_acl_id=Token.as_string(aws_network_acl_main.id),
            subnet_id=Token.as_string(aws_subnet_main.id)
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `network_acl_id` - (Required) The ID of the network ACL.
* `subnet_id` - (Required) The ID of the associated Subnet.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The ID of the network ACL association

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Network ACL associations using the `id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.network_acl_association import NetworkAclAssociation
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        NetworkAclAssociation.generate_config_for_import(self, "main", "aclassoc-02baf37f20966b3e6")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Network ACL associations using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_network_acl_association.main aclassoc-02baf37f20966b3e6
```
