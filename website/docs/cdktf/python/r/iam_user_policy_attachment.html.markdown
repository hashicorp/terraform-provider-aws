# Resource: aws_iam_user_policy_attachment

Attaches a Managed IAM Policy to an IAM user

~> **NOTE:** The usage of this resource conflicts with the `aws_iam_policy_attachment` resource and will permanently show a difference if both are defined.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.iam_policy import IamPolicy
from imports.aws.iam_user import IamUser
from imports.aws.iam_user_policy_attachment import IamUserPolicyAttachment
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        policy = IamPolicy(self, "policy",
            description="A test policy",
            name="test-policy",
            policy="{ ... policy JSON ... }"
        )
        user = IamUser(self, "user",
            name="test-user"
        )
        IamUserPolicyAttachment(self, "test-attach",
            policy_arn=policy.arn,
            user=user.name
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `user`        (Required) - The user the policy should be applied to
* `policy_arn`  (Required) - The ARN of the policy you want to apply

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports no additional attributes.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import IAM user policy attachments using the user name and policy arn separated by `/`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.iam_user_policy_attachment import IamUserPolicyAttachment
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        IamUserPolicyAttachment.generate_config_for_import(self, "testAttach", "test-user/arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:policy/test-policy")
```

Using `terraform import`, import IAM user policy attachments using the user name and policy arn separated by `/`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_iam_user_policy_attachment.test-attach test-user/arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:policy/test-policy
```
