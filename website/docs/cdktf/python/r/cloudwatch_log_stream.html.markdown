# Resource: aws_cloudwatch_log_stream

Provides a CloudWatch Log Stream resource.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.cloudwatch_log_group import CloudwatchLogGroup
from imports.aws.cloudwatch_log_stream import CloudwatchLogStream
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        yada = CloudwatchLogGroup(self, "yada",
            name="Yada"
        )
        CloudwatchLogStream(self, "foo",
            log_group_name=yada.name,
            name="SampleLogStream1234"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the log stream. Must not be longer than 512 characters and must not contain `:`
* `log_group_name` - (Required) The name of the log group under which the log stream is to be created.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) specifying the log stream.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Cloudwatch Log Stream using the stream's `log_group_name` and `name`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Using `terraform import`, import Cloudwatch Log Stream using the stream's `log_group_name` and `name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_cloudwatch_log_stream.foo Yada:SampleLogStream1234
```
