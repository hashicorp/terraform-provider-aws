# Resource: aws_detective_graph

Provides a resource to manage an [AWS Detective Graph](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/APIReference/API_CreateGraph.html). As an AWS account may own only one Detective graph per region, provisioning multiple Detective graphs requires a separate provider configuration for each graph.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.detective_graph import DetectiveGraph
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DetectiveGraph(self, "example",
            tags={
                "Name": "example-detective-graph"
            }
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are optional:

* `tags` -  (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the instance. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - ARN of the Detective Graph.
* `graph_arn` - ARN of the Detective Graph.
* `created_time` - Date and time, in UTC and extended RFC 3339 format, when the Amazon Detective Graph was created.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_detective_graph` using the ARN. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.detective_graph import DetectiveGraph
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DetectiveGraph.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "arn:aws:detective:us-east-1:123456789101:graph:231684d34gh74g4bae1dbc7bd807d02d")
```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_detective_graph` using the ARN. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_detective_graph.example arn:aws:detective:us-east-1:123456789101:graph:231684d34gh74g4bae1dbc7bd807d02d
```
