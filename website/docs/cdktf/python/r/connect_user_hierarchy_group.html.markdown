# Resource: aws_connect_user_hierarchy_group

Provides an Amazon Connect User Hierarchy Group resource. For more information see
[Amazon Connect: Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-get-started.html)

~> **NOTE:** The User Hierarchy Structure must be created before creating a User Hierarchy Group.

## Example Usage

### Basic

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.connect_user_hierarchy_group import ConnectUserHierarchyGroup
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        ConnectUserHierarchyGroup(self, "example",
            instance_id="aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-111111111111",
            name="example",
            tags={
                "Name": "Example User Hierarchy Group"
            }
        )
```

### With a parent group

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.connect_user_hierarchy_group import ConnectUserHierarchyGroup
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        parent = ConnectUserHierarchyGroup(self, "parent",
            instance_id="aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-111111111111",
            name="parent",
            tags={
                "Name": "Example User Hierarchy Group Parent"
            }
        )
        ConnectUserHierarchyGroup(self, "child",
            instance_id="aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-111111111111",
            name="child",
            parent_group_id=parent.hierarchy_group_id,
            tags={
                "Name": "Example User Hierarchy Group Child"
            }
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `instance_id` - (Required) Specifies the identifier of the hosting Amazon Connect Instance.
* `name` - (Required) The name of the user hierarchy group. Must not be more than 100 characters.
* `parent_group_id` - (Optional) The identifier for the parent hierarchy group. The user hierarchy is created at level one if the parent group ID is null.
* `tags` - (Optional) Tags to apply to the hierarchy group. If configured with a provider
[`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the hierarchy group.
* `hierarchy_group_id` - The identifier for the hierarchy group.
* `hierarchy_path` - A block that contains information about the levels in the hierarchy group. The `hierarchy_path` block is documented below.
* `id` - The identifier of the hosting Amazon Connect Instance and identifier of the hierarchy group
separated by a colon (`:`).
* `level_id` - The identifier of the level in the hierarchy group.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

A `hierarchy_path` block supports the following attributes:

* `level_one` - A block that defines the details of level one. The level block is documented below.
* `level_two` - A block that defines the details of level two. The level block is documented below.
* `level_three` - A block that defines the details of level three. The level block is documented below.
* `level_four` - A block that defines the details of level four. The level block is documented below.
* `level_five` - A block that defines the details of level five. The level block is documented below.

A level block supports the following attributes:

* `arn` -  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the hierarchy group.
* `id` -  The identifier of the hierarchy group.
* `name` - The name of the hierarchy group.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Amazon Connect User Hierarchy Groups using the `instance_id` and `hierarchy_group_id` separated by a colon (`:`). For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.connect_user_hierarchy_group import ConnectUserHierarchyGroup
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        ConnectUserHierarchyGroup.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "f1288a1f-6193-445a-b47e-af739b2:c1d4e5f6-1b3c-1b3c-1b3c-c1d4e5f6c1d4e5")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Amazon Connect User Hierarchy Groups using the `instance_id` and `hierarchy_group_id` separated by a colon (`:`). For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_connect_user_hierarchy_group.example f1288a1f-6193-445a-b47e-af739b2:c1d4e5f6-1b3c-1b3c-1b3c-c1d4e5f6c1d4e5
```
