# Resource: aws_ram_principal_association

Provides a Resource Access Manager (RAM) principal association. Depending if [RAM Sharing with AWS Organizations is enabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/getting-started-sharing.html#getting-started-sharing-orgs), the RAM behavior with different principal types changes.

When RAM Sharing with AWS Organizations is enabled:

- For AWS Account ID, Organization, and Organizational Unit principals within the same AWS Organization, no resource share invitation is sent and resources become available automatically after creating the association.
- For AWS Account ID principals outside the AWS Organization, a resource share invitation is sent and must be accepted before resources become available. See the [`aws_ram_resource_share_accepter` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/ram_resource_share_accepter.html) to accept these invitations.

When RAM Sharing with AWS Organizations is not enabled:

- Organization and Organizational Unit principals cannot be used.
- For AWS Account ID principals, a resource share invitation is sent and must be accepted before resources become available. See the [`aws_ram_resource_share_accepter` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/ram_resource_share_accepter.html) to accept these invitations.

## Example Usage

### AWS Account ID

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.ram_principal_association import RamPrincipalAssociation
from imports.aws.ram_resource_share import RamResourceShare
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name, *, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = RamResourceShare(self, "example",
            allow_external_principals=True,
            name=name
        )
        aws_ram_principal_association_example = RamPrincipalAssociation(self, "example_1",
            principal="111111111111",
            resource_share_arn=example.arn
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_ram_principal_association_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

### AWS Organization

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.ram_principal_association import RamPrincipalAssociation
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        RamPrincipalAssociation(self, "example",
            principal=Token.as_string(aws_organizations_organization_example.arn),
            resource_share_arn=Token.as_string(aws_ram_resource_share_example.arn)
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `principal` - (Required) The principal to associate with the resource share. Possible values are an AWS account ID, an AWS Organizations Organization ARN, or an AWS Organizations Organization Unit ARN.
* `resource_share_arn` - (Required) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource share.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Resource Share and the principal, separated by a comma.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import RAM Principal Associations using their Resource Share ARN and the `principal` separated by a comma. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.ram_principal_association import RamPrincipalAssociation
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        RamPrincipalAssociation.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "arn:aws:ram:eu-west-1:123456789012:resource-share/73da1ab9-b94a-4ba3-8eb4-45917f7f4b12,123456789012")
```

Using `terraform import`, import RAM Principal Associations using their Resource Share ARN and the `principal` separated by a comma. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_ram_principal_association.example arn:aws:ram:eu-west-1:123456789012:resource-share/73da1ab9-b94a-4ba3-8eb4-45917f7f4b12,123456789012
```
