# Resource: aws_gamelift_script

Provides an GameLift Script resource.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.gamelift_script import GameliftScript
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        GameliftScript(self, "example",
            name="example-script",
            storage_location=GameliftScriptStorageLocation(
                bucket=Token.as_string(aws_s3_bucket_example.id),
                key=Token.as_string(aws_s3_object_example.key),
                role_arn=Token.as_string(aws_iam_role_example.arn)
            )
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the script
* `storage_location` - (Optional) Information indicating where your game script files are stored. See below.
* `version` - (Optional) Version that is associated with this script.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `zip_file` - (Optional) A data object containing your Realtime scripts and dependencies as a zip  file. The zip file can have one or multiple files. Maximum size of a zip file is 5 MB.

### Nested Fields

#### `storage_location`

* `bucket` - (Required) Name of your S3 bucket.
* `key` - (Required) Name of the zip file containing your script files.
* `role_arn` - (Required) ARN of the access role that allows Amazon GameLift to access your S3 bucket.
* `object_version` - (Optional) A specific version of the file. If not set, the latest version of the file is retrieved.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - GameLift Script ID.
* `arn` - GameLift Script ARN.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import GameLift Scripts using the ID. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.gamelift_script import GameliftScript
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        GameliftScript.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "<script-id>")
```

Using `terraform import`, import GameLift Scripts using the ID. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_gamelift_script.example <script-id>
```
