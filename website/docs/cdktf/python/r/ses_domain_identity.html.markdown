# Resource: aws_ses_domain_identity

Provides an SES domain identity resource

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.ses_domain_identity import SesDomainIdentity
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        SesDomainIdentity(self, "example",
            domain="example.com"
        )
```

### With Route53 Record

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.route53_record import Route53Record
from imports.aws.ses_domain_identity import SesDomainIdentity
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = SesDomainIdentity(self, "example",
            domain="example.com"
        )
        Route53Record(self, "example_amazonses_verification_record",
            name="_amazonses.example.com",
            records=[example.verification_token],
            ttl=Token.as_number("600"),
            type="TXT",
            zone_id="ABCDEFGHIJ123"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `domain` - (Required) The domain name to assign to SES

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - The ARN of the domain identity.
* `verification_token` - A code which when added to the domain as a TXT record
  will signal to SES that the owner of the domain has authorised SES to act on
  their behalf. The domain identity will be in state "verification pending"
  until this is done. See the [With Route53 Record](#with-route53-record) example
  for how this might be achieved when the domain is hosted in Route 53 and
  managed by Terraform.  Find out more about verifying domains in Amazon
  SES in the [AWS SES
  docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-domains.html).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import SES domain identities using the domain name. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Using `terraform import`, import SES domain identities using the domain name. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_ses_domain_identity.example example.com
```
