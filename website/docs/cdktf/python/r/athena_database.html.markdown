# Resource: aws_athena_database

Provides an Athena database.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.athena_database import AthenaDatabase
from imports.aws.s3_bucket import S3Bucket
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = S3Bucket(self, "example",
            bucket="example"
        )
        aws_athena_database_example = AthenaDatabase(self, "example_1",
            bucket=example.id,
            name="database_name"
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_athena_database_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `bucket` - (Required) Name of S3 bucket to save the results of the query execution.
* `name` - (Required) Name of the database to create.
* `acl_configuration` - (Optional) That an Amazon S3 canned ACL should be set to control ownership of stored query results. See [ACL Configuration](#acl-configuration) below.
* `comment` - (Optional) Description of the database.
* `encryption_configuration` - (Optional) Encryption key block AWS Athena uses to decrypt the data in S3, such as an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key. See [Encryption Configuration](#encryption-configuration) below.
* `expected_bucket_owner` - (Optional) AWS account ID that you expect to be the owner of the Amazon S3 bucket.
* `force_destroy` - (Optional, Default: false) Boolean that indicates all tables should be deleted from the database so that the database can be destroyed without error. The tables are *not* recoverable.
* `properties` - (Optional) Key-value map of custom metadata properties for the database definition.

### ACL Configuration

* `s3_acl_option` - (Required) Amazon S3 canned ACL that Athena should specify when storing query results. Valid value is `BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL`.

~> **NOTE:** When Athena queries are executed, result files may be created in the specified bucket. Consider using `force_destroy` on the bucket too in order to avoid any problems when destroying the bucket.  

### Encryption Configuration

* `encryption_option` - (Required) Type of key; one of `SSE_S3`, `SSE_KMS`, `CSE_KMS`
* `kms_key` - (Optional) KMS key ARN or ID; required for key types `SSE_KMS` and `CSE_KMS`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - Database name

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Athena Databases using their name. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.athena_database import AthenaDatabase
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        AthenaDatabase.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "example")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Athena Databases using their name. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_athena_database.example example
```

Certain resource arguments, like `encryption_configuration` and `bucket`, do not have an API method for reading the information after creation. If the argument is set in the Terraform configuration on an imported resource, Terraform will always show a difference. To workaround this behavior, either omit the argument from the Terraform configuration or use [`ignore_changes`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/meta-arguments/lifecycle.html#ignore_changes) to hide the difference. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from cdktf import TerraformResourceLifecycle
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.athena_database import AthenaDatabase
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        AthenaDatabase(self, "example",
            bucket=Token.as_string(aws_s3_bucket_example.id),
            lifecycle=TerraformResourceLifecycle(
                ignore_changes=[bucket]
            ),
            name="database_name"
        )
```
