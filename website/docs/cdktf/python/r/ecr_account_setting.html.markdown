# Resource: aws_ecr_account_setting

Provides a resource to manage AWS ECR Basic Scan Type

## Example Usage

### Configuring Basic Scanning

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.ecr_account_setting import EcrAccountSetting
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        EcrAccountSetting(self, "basic_scan_type_version",
            name="BASIC_SCAN_TYPE_VERSION",
            value="AWS_NATIVE"
        )
```

### Configuring Registry Policy Scope

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.ecr_account_setting import EcrAccountSetting
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        EcrAccountSetting(self, "registry_policy_scope",
            name="REGISTRY_POLICY_SCOPE",
            value="V2"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the account setting. One of: `BASIC_SCAN_TYPE_VERSION`, `REGISTRY_POLICY_SCOPE`.
* `value` - (Required) Setting value that is specified. Valid values are:
    * If `name` is specified as `BASIC_SCAN_TYPE_VERSION`, one of: `AWS_NATIVE`, `CLAIR`.
    * If `name` is specified as `REGISTRY_POLICY_SCOPE`, one of: `V1`, `V2`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - Name of the account setting.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import ECR Scan Type using the `name`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.ecr_account_setting import EcrAccountSetting
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        EcrAccountSetting.generate_config_for_import(self, "foo", "BASIC_SCAN_TYPE_VERSION")
```

Using `terraform import`, import EMR Security Configurations using the account setting name. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_ecr_account_setting.foo BASIC_SCAN_TYPE_VERSION
```
