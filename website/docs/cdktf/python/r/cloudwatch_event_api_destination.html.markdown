from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.cloudwatch_event_api_destination import CloudwatchEventApiDestination
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CloudwatchEventApiDestination(self, "test",
            connection_arn=Token.as_string(aws_cloudwatch_event_connection_test.arn),
            description="An API Destination",
            http_method="POST",
            invocation_endpoint="https://api.destination.com/endpoint",
            invocation_rate_limit_per_second=20,
            name="api-destination"
        )
```

* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the event API Destination.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import EventBridge API Destinations using the `name`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.cloudwatch_event_api_destination import CloudwatchEventApiDestination
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CloudwatchEventApiDestination.generate_config_for_import(self, "test", "api-destination")
```

Using `terraform import`, import EventBridge API Destinations using the `name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_cloudwatch_event_api_destination.test api-destination
```
