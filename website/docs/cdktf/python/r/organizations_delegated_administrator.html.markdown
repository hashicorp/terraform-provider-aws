```terraform
import {
  to = aws_organizations_delegated_administrator.example
  identity = {
    service_principal    = "config.amazonaws.com"
    delegated_account_id = "123456789012"

}
```

* `delegated_account_id` (String) Account ID to be designated as a delegated administrator.

#### Optional

* `account_id` (String) AWS Account where this resource is managed.

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_organizations_delegated_administrator` using the account ID and its service principal. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.organizations_delegated_administrator import OrganizationsDelegatedAdministrator
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        OrganizationsDelegatedAdministrator.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "123456789012/config.amazonaws.com")
```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_organizations_delegated_administrator` using the account ID and its service principal. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_organizations_delegated_administrator.example 123456789012/config.amazonaws.com
```
