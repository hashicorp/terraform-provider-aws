# Resource: aws_backup_vault

Provides an AWS Backup vault resource.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.backup_vault import BackupVault
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        BackupVault(self, "example",
            kms_key_arn=Token.as_string(aws_kms_key_example.arn),
            name="example_backup_vault"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `region` - (Optional) Region where this resource will be [managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints). Defaults to the Region set in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#aws-configuration-reference).
* `force_destroy` - (Optional, Default: `false`) A boolean that indicates that all recovery points stored in the vault are deleted so that the vault can be destroyed without error.
* `kms_key_arn` - (Optional) The server-side encryption key that is used to protect your backups.
* `name` - (Required) Name of the backup vault to create.
* `tags` - (Optional) Metadata that you can assign to help organize the resources that you create. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The name of the vault.
* `arn` - The ARN of the vault.
* `recovery_points` - The number of recovery points that are stored in a backup vault.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

- `delete` - (Default `10m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Backup vault using the `name`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.backup_vault import BackupVault
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        BackupVault.generate_config_for_import(self, "testVault", "TestVault")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Backup vault using the `name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_backup_vault.test-vault TestVault
```
