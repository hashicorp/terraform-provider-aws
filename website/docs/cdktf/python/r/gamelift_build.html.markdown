from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.

#
from imports.aws.gamelift_build import GameliftBuild
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        GameliftBuild(self, "test",
            name="example-build",
            operating_system="WINDOWS_2012",
            storage_location=GameliftBuildStorageLocation(
                bucket=Token.as_string(aws_s3_bucket_test.id),
                key=Token.as_string(aws_s3_object_test.key),
                role_arn=Token.as_string(aws_iam_role_test.arn)
            )
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the build
* `operating_system` - (Required) Operating system that the game server binaries are built to run on. Valid values: `WINDOWS_2012`, `AMAZON_LINUX`, `AMAZON_LINUX_2`, `WINDOWS_2016`, `AMAZON_LINUX_2023`.
* `storage_location` - (Required) Information indicating where your game build files are stored. See below.
* `version` - (Optional) Version that is associated with this build.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

### Nested Fields

#### `storage_location`

* `bucket` - (Required) Name of your S3 bucket.
* `key` - (Required) Name of the zip file containing your build files.
* `role_arn` - (Required) ARN of the access role that allows Amazon GameLift to access your S3 bucket.
* `object_version` - (Optional) A specific version of the file. If not set, the latest version of the file is retrieved.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - GameLift Build ID.
* `arn` - GameLift Build ARN.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import GameLift Builds using the ID. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.gamelift_build import GameliftBuild
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        GameliftBuild.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "<build-id>")
```

Using `terraform import`, import GameLift Builds using the ID. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_gamelift_build.example <build-id>
```
