# Resource: aws_cognito_user_pool_client

Provides a Cognito User Pool Client resource.

To manage a User Pool Client created by another service, such as when [configuring an OpenSearch Domain to use Cognito authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/cognito-auth.html),
use the [`aws_cognito_managed_user_pool_client` resource](cognito_managed_user_pool_client.html) instead.

## Example Usage

### Create a basic user pool client

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.cognito_user_pool import CognitoUserPool
from imports.aws.cognito_user_pool_client import CognitoUserPoolClient
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        pool = CognitoUserPool(self, "pool",
            name="pool"
        )

            name="client",
            user_pool_id=pool.id
        )
```

### Create a user pool client with no SRP authentication

* `auth_session_validity` - (Optional) Duration, in minutes, of the session token created by Amazon Cognito for each API request in an authentication flow. The session token must be responded to by the native user of the user pool before it expires. Valid values for `auth_session_validity` are between `3` and `15`, with a default value of `3`.
* `callback_urls` - (Optional) List of allowed callback URLs for the identity providers. `allowed_oauth_flows_user_pool_client` must be set to `true` before you can configure this option.

* `prevent_user_existence_errors` - (Optional) Setting determines the errors and responses returned by Cognito APIs when a user does not exist in the user pool during authentication, account confirmation, and password recovery.
* `read_attributes` - (Optional) List of user pool attributes that the application client can read from.

* `supported_identity_providers` - (Optional) List of provider names for the identity providers that are supported on this client. It uses the `provider_name` attribute of the `aws_cognito_identity_provider` resource(s), or the equivalent string(s).
* `token_validity_units` - (Optional) Configuration block for representing the validity times in units. See details below. [Detailed below](#token_validity_units).
* `write_attributes` - (Optional) List of user pool attributes that the application client can write to.

### token_validity_units

Valid values for the following arguments are: `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours` or `days`.

* `access_token` - (Optional) Time unit in for the value in `access_token_validity`, defaults to `hours`.
* `id_token` - (Optional) Time unit in for the value in `id_token_validity`, defaults to `hours`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `client_secret` - Client secret of the user pool client.
* `id` - ID of the user pool client.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Cognito User Pool Clients using the `id` of the Cognito User Pool, and the `id` of the Cognito User Pool Client. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.cognito_user_pool_client import CognitoUserPoolClient
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CognitoUserPoolClient.generate_config_for_import(self, "client", "us-west-2_abc123/3ho4ek12345678909nh3fmhpko")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Cognito User Pool Clients using the `id` of the Cognito User Pool, and the `id` of the Cognito User Pool Client. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_cognito_user_pool_client.client us-west-2_abc123/3ho4ek12345678909nh3fmhpko
```
