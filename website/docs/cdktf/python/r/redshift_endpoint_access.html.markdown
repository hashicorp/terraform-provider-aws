# Resource: aws_redshift_endpoint_access

Creates a new Amazon Redshift endpoint access.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.redshift_endpoint_access import RedshiftEndpointAccess
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        RedshiftEndpointAccess(self, "example",
            cluster_identifier=Token.as_string(aws_redshift_cluster_example.cluster_identifier),
            endpoint_name="example",
            subnet_group_name=Token.as_string(aws_redshift_subnet_group_example.id)
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `cluster_identifier` - (Required) The cluster identifier of the cluster to access.
* `endpoint_name` - (Required) The Redshift-managed VPC endpoint name.
* `resource_owner` - (Optional) The Amazon Web Services account ID of the owner of the cluster. This is only required if the cluster is in another Amazon Web Services account.
* `subnet_group_name` - (Required) The subnet group from which Amazon Redshift chooses the subnet to deploy the endpoint.
* `vpc_security_group_ids` - (Optional) The security group that defines the ports, protocols, and sources for inbound traffic that you are authorizing into your endpoint.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `address` - The DNS address of the endpoint.
* `id` - The Redshift-managed VPC endpoint name.
* `port` - The port number on which the cluster accepts incoming connections.
* `vpc_endpoint` - The connection endpoint for connecting to an Amazon Redshift cluster through the proxy. See details below.

### VPC Endpoint

* `network_interface` - One or more network interfaces of the endpoint. Also known as an interface endpoint. See details below.
* `vpc_endpoint_id` - The connection endpoint ID for connecting an Amazon Redshift cluster through the proxy.
* `vpc_id` - The VPC identifier that the endpoint is associated.

### Network Interface

* `availability_zone` - The Availability Zone.
* `network_interface_id` - The network interface identifier.
* `private_ip_address` - The IPv4 address of the network interface within the subnet.
* `subnet_id` - The subnet identifier.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Redshift endpoint access using the `name`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.redshift_endpoint_access import RedshiftEndpointAccess
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        RedshiftEndpointAccess.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "example")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Redshift endpoint access using the `name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_redshift_endpoint_access.example example
```
