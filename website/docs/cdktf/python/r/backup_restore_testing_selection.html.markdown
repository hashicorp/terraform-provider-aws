## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Backup Restore Testing Selection using `name:restore_testing_plan_name`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws. import BackupRestoreTestingSelection
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        BackupRestoreTestingSelection.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "my_testing_selection:my_testing_plan")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Backup Restore Testing Selection using `name:restore_testing_plan_name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_backup_restore_testing_selection.example restore_testing_selection_12345678:restore_testing_plan_12345678
```
