# Resource: aws_location_geofence_collection

Terraform resource for managing an AWS Location Geofence Collection.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.location_geofence_collection import LocationGeofenceCollection
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        LocationGeofenceCollection(self, "example",
            collection_name="example"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `collection_name` - (Required) The name of the geofence collection.

The following arguments are optional:

* `kms_key_id` - (Optional) A key identifier for an AWS KMS customer managed key assigned to the Amazon Location resource.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value tags for the geofence collection. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

* `create_time` - The timestamp for when the geofence collection resource was created in ISO 8601 format.
* `update_time` - The timestamp for when the geofence collection resource was last updated in ISO 8601 format.

## Timeouts

* `create` - (Default `30m`)
* `update` - (Default `30m`)
* `delete` - (Default `30m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Location Geofence Collection using the `collection_name`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.location_geofence_collection import LocationGeofenceCollection
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        LocationGeofenceCollection.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "example")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Location Geofence Collection using the `collection_name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_location_geofence_collection.example example
```
