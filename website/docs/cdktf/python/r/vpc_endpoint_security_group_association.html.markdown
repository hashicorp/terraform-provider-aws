# Resource: aws_vpc_endpoint_security_group_association

Provides a resource to create an association between a VPC endpoint and a security group.

~> **NOTE on VPC Endpoints and VPC Endpoint Security Group Associations:** Terraform provides
both a standalone VPC Endpoint Security Group Association (an association between a VPC endpoint
and a single `security_group_id`) and a [VPC Endpoint](vpc_endpoint.html) resource with a `security_group_ids`
attribute. Do not use the same security group ID in both a VPC Endpoint resource and a VPC Endpoint Security
Group Association resource. Doing so will cause a conflict of associations and will overwrite the association.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.vpc_endpoint_security_group_association import VpcEndpointSecurityGroupAssociation
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        VpcEndpointSecurityGroupAssociation(self, "sg_ec2",
            security_group_id=sg.id,
            vpc_endpoint_id=ec2.id
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `security_group_id` - (Required) The ID of the security group to be associated with the VPC endpoint.
* `vpc_endpoint_id` - (Required) The ID of the VPC endpoint with which the security group will be associated.
* `replace_default_association` - (Optional) Whether this association should replace the association with the VPC's default security group that is created when no security groups are specified during VPC endpoint creation. At most 1 association per-VPC endpoint should be configured with `replace_default_association = true`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The ID of the association.
