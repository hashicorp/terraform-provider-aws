## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `enabled` - (Required) Whether this continuous deployment policy is enabled.
* `staging_distribution_dns_names` - (Required) CloudFront domain name of the staging distribution. See [`staging_distribution_dns_names`](#staging_distribution_dns_names).
* `traffic_config` - (Required) Parameters for routing production traffic from primary to staging distributions. See [`traffic_config`](#traffic_config).

### `staging_distribution_dns_names`

* `items` - (Required) A list of CloudFront domain names for the staging distribution.
* `quantity` - (Required) Number of CloudFront domain names in the staging distribution.

### `traffic_config`

* `type` - (Required) Type of traffic configuration. Valid values are `SingleWeight` and `SingleHeader`.
* `single_header_config` - (Optional) Determines which HTTP requests are sent to the staging distribution. See [`single_header_config`](#single_header_config).
* `single_weight_config` - (Optional) Contains the percentage of traffic to send to the staging distribution. See [`single_weight_config`](#single_weight_config).

### `single_header_config`

* `header` - (Required) Request header name to send to the staging distribution. The header must contain the prefix `aws-cf-cd-`.
* `value` - (Required) Request header value.

### `single_weight_config`

* `weight` - (Required) The percentage of traffic to send to a staging distribution, expressed as a decimal number between `0` and `.15`.
* `session_stickiness_config` - (Optional) Session stickiness provides the ability to define multiple requests from a single viewer as a single session. This prevents the potentially inconsistent experience of sending some of a given user's requests to the staging distribution, while others are sent to the primary distribution. Define the session duration using TTL values. See [`session_stickiness_config`](#session_stickiness_config).

### `session_stickiness_config`

* `idle_ttl` - (Required) The amount of time in seconds after which sessions will cease if no requests are received. Valid values are `300` – `3600` (5–60 minutes). The value must be less than or equal to `maximum_ttl`.
* `maximum_ttl` - (Required) The maximum amount of time in seconds to consider requests from the viewer as being part of the same session. Valid values are `300` – `3600` (5–60 minutes). The value must be greater than or equal to `idle_ttl`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `etag` - Current version of the continuous distribution policy.
* `id` - Identifier of the continuous deployment policy.
* `last_modified_time` - Date and time the continuous deployment policy was last modified.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import CloudFront Continuous Deployment Policy using the `id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.cloudfront_continuous_deployment_policy import CloudfrontContinuousDeploymentPolicy
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CloudfrontContinuousDeploymentPolicy.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "abcd-1234")
```

Using `terraform import`, import CloudFront Continuous Deployment Policy using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_cloudfront_continuous_deployment_policy.example abcd-1234 
```
