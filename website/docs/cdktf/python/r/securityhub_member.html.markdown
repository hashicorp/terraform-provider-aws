from imports.aws.securityhub_account import SecurityhubAccount
from imports.aws.securityhub_member import SecurityhubMember
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = SecurityhubAccount(self, "example")

            email="example@example.com",
            invite=True
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_securityhub_member_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Security Hub members using their account ID. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.securityhub_member import SecurityhubMember
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        SecurityhubMember.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "123456789012")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Security Hub members using their account ID. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_securityhub_member.example 123456789012
```
