## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import App Runner Services using the `arn`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.apprunner_service import ApprunnerService
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        ApprunnerService.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:1234567890:service/example/0a03292a89764e5882c41d8f991c82fe")
```

Using `terraform import`, import App Runner Services using the `arn`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_apprunner_service.example arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:1234567890:service/example/0a03292a89764e5882c41d8f991c82fe
```
