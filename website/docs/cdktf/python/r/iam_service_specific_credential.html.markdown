# Resource: aws_iam_service_specific_credential

Provides an IAM Service Specific Credential.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.iam_service_specific_credential import IamServiceSpecificCredential
from imports.aws.iam_user import IamUser
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = IamUser(self, "example",
            name="example"
        )
        aws_iam_service_specific_credential_example =
        IamServiceSpecificCredential(self, "example_1",
            service_name="codecommit.amazonaws.com",
            user_name=example.name
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_iam_service_specific_credential_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `service_name` - (Required) The name of the AWS service that is to be associated with the credentials. The service you specify here is the only service that can be accessed using these credentials.
* `user_name` - (Required) The name of the IAM user that is to be associated with the credentials. The new service-specific credentials have the same permissions as the associated user except that they can be used only to access the specified service.
* `status` - (Optional) The status to be assigned to the service-specific credential. Valid values are `Active` and `Inactive`. Default value is `Active`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The combination of `service_name` and `user_name` as such: `service_name:user_name:service_specific_credential_id`.
* `service_password` - The generated password for the service-specific credential.
* `service_user_name` - The generated user name for the service-specific credential. This value is generated by combining the IAM user's name combined with the ID number of the AWS account, as in `jane-at-123456789012`, for example.
* `service_specific_credential_id` - The unique identifier for the service-specific credential.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import IAM Service Specific Credentials using the `service_name:user_name:service_specific_credential_id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.iam_service_specific_credential import IamServiceSpecificCredential
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        IamServiceSpecificCredential.generate_config_for_import(self, "default", "`codecommit.amazonaws.com:example:some-id`")
```

Using `terraform import`, import IAM Service Specific Credentials using the `service_name:user_name:service_specific_credential_id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_iam_service_specific_credential.default `codecommit.amazonaws.com:example:some-id`
```
