Terraform resource for managing an AWS Service Catalog AppRegistry Application.

~> An AWS Service Catalog AppRegistry Application is displayed in the AWS Console under "MyApplications".

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.servicecatalogappregistry_application import ServicecatalogappregistryApplication
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        ServicecatalogappregistryApplication(self, "example",
            name="example-app"
        )
```

### Connecting Resources

```python

from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.

from imports.aws.s3_bucket import S3Bucket
from imports.aws.servicecatalogappregistry_application import ServicecatalogappregistryApplication
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = ServicecatalogappregistryApplication(self, "example",
            name="example-app"
        )
        S3Bucket(self, "bucket",
            bucket="example-bucket",
            tags=example.application_tag
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the application. The name must be unique within an AWS region.

The following arguments are optional:

* `description` - (Optional) Description of the application.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags assigned to the Application. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `application_tag` - A map with a single tag key-value pair used to associate resources with the application. This attribute can be passed directly into the `tags` argument of another resource, or merged into a map of existing tags.
* `arn` - ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the application.
* `id` - Identifier of the application.
* `tags_all` - Map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Service Catalog AppRegistry Application using the `id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.servicecatalogappregistry_application import ServicecatalogappregistryApplication
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        ServicecatalogappregistryApplication.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "application-id-12345678")
```

Using `terraform import`, import AWS Service Catalog AppRegistry Application using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_servicecatalogappregistry_application.example application-id-12345678
```
