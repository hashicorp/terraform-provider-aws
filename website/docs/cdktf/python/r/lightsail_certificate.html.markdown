# Resource: aws_lightsail_certificate

Provides a lightsail certificate.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.lightsail_certificate import LightsailCertificate
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        LightsailCertificate(self, "test",
            domain_name="testdomain.com",
            name="test",
            subject_alternative_names=["www.testdomain.com"]
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the Lightsail load balancer.
* `domain_name` - (Required) A domain name for which the certificate should be issued.
* `subject_alternative_names` - (Optional) Set of domains that should be SANs in the issued certificate. `domain_name` attribute is automatically added as a Subject Alternative Name.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. To create a key-only tag, use an empty string as the value. If configured with a provider `default_tags` configuration block present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The name of the lightsail certificate (matches `name`).
* `arn` - The ARN of the lightsail certificate.
* `created_at` - The timestamp when the instance was created.
* `domain_validation_options` - Set of domain validation objects which can be used to complete certificate validation. Can have more than one element, e.g., if SANs are defined.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider `default_tags` configuration block.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_lightsail_certificate` using the certificate name. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_lightsail_certificate` using the certificate name. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_lightsail_certificate.test CertificateName
```
