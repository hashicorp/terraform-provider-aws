# Resource: aws_vpc_route_server_propagation

  Provides a resource for managing propagation between VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) route server and a route table.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws. import VpcRouteServerPropagation
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        VpcRouteServerPropagation(self, "example",
            route_server_id=aws_vpc_route_server_example.route_server_id,
            route_table_id=aws_route_table_example.id
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `route_server_id` - (Required) The unique identifier for the route server to be associated.
* `route_table_id` - (Required) The ID of the route table to which route server will propagate routes.

This resource exports no additional attributes.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `create` - (Default `30m`)
* `delete` - (Default `30m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to  to import VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) Route Server Propagation using the associated resource ID and route table ID separated by a comma (,). For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws. import VpcRouteServerPropagation
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        VpcRouteServerPropagation.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "rs-12345678,rtb-656c65616e6f72")
```

Using `terraform import`, to  to import VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) Route Server Propagation using the associated resource ID and route table ID separated by a comma (,). For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_vpc_route_server_propagation.example rs-12345678,rtb-656c65616e6f72
```
