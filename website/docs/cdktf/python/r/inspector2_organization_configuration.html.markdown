from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.inspector2_organization_configuration import Inspector2OrganizationConfiguration
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        Inspector2OrganizationConfiguration(self, "example",
            auto_enable=Inspector2OrganizationConfigurationAutoEnable(
                ec2=True,
                ecr=False,
                lambda_=True,
                lambda_code=True
            )

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `auto_enable` - (Required) Configuration block for auto enabling. See below.

### `auto_enable`

* `lambda` - (Optional) Whether Lambda Function scans are automatically enabled for new members of your Amazon Inspector organization.
