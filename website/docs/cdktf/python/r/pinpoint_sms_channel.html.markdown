#
from imports.aws.pinpoint_app import PinpointApp
from imports.aws.pinpoint_sms_channel import PinpointSmsChannel
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        app = PinpointApp(self, "app")
        PinpointSmsChannel(self, "sms",
            application_id=app.application_id
        )
```

## Argument Reference

* `application_id` - (Required) ID of the application.
* `enabled` - (Optional) Whether the channel is enabled or disabled. By default, it is set to `true`.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import the Pinpoint SMS Channel using the `application_id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.pinpoint_sms_channel import PinpointSmsChannel
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        PinpointSmsChannel.generate_config_for_import(self, "sms", "application-id")
```

Using `terraform import`, import the Pinpoint SMS Channel using the `application_id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_pinpoint_sms_channel.sms application-id
```
