# Resource: aws_shield_subscription

Terraform resource for managing an AWS Shield Subscription.

~> This resource creates a subscription to AWS Shield Advanced, which requires a 1 year subscription commitment with a monthly fee. Refer to the [AWS Shield Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/shield/pricing/) page for more details.

~> Destruction of this resource will set `auto_renew` to `DISABLED`. Automatic renewal can only be disabled during the last 30 days of a subscription. To unsubscribe outside of this window, you must contact AWS Support. Set `skip_destroy` to `true` to skip modifying the `auto_renew` argument during destruction.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.shield_subscription import ShieldSubscription
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        ShieldSubscription(self, "example",
            auto_renew="ENABLED"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are optional:

* `auto_renew` - (Optional) Toggle for automated renewal of the subscription. Valid values are `ENABLED` or `DISABLED`. Default is `ENABLED`.
* `skip_destroy` - (Optional) Skip attempting to disable automated renewal upon destruction. If set to `true`, the `auto_renew` value will be left as-is and the resource will simply be removed from state.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - AWS Account ID.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Shield Subscription using the `id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.shield_subscription import ShieldSubscription
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        ShieldSubscription.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "012345678901")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Shield Subscription using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_shield_subscription.example 012345678901
```
