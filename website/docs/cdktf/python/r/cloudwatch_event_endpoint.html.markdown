# Resource: aws_cloudwatch_event_endpoint

Provides a resource to create an EventBridge Global Endpoint.

~> **Note:** EventBridge was formerly known as CloudWatch Events. The functionality is identical.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.cloudwatch_event_endpoint import CloudwatchEventEndpoint
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CloudwatchEventEndpoint(self, "this",
            event_bus=[CloudwatchEventEndpointEventBus(
                event_bus_arn=primary.arn
            ), CloudwatchEventEndpointEventBus(
                event_bus_arn=secondary.arn
            )
            ],
            name="global-endpoint",
            replication_config=CloudwatchEventEndpointReplicationConfig(
                state="DISABLED"
            ),
            role_arn=replication.arn,
            routing_config=CloudwatchEventEndpointRoutingConfig(
                failover_config=CloudwatchEventEndpointRoutingConfigFailoverConfig(
                    primary=CloudwatchEventEndpointRoutingConfigFailoverConfigPrimary(
                        health_check=Token.as_string(aws_route53_health_check_primary.arn)
                    ),
                    secondary=CloudwatchEventEndpointRoutingConfigFailoverConfigSecondary(
                        route="us-east-2"
                    )
                )
            )
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `description` - (Optional) A description of the global endpoint.
* `event_bus` - (Required) The event buses to use. The names of the event buses must be identical in each Region. Exactly two event buses are required. Documented below.
* `name` - (Required) The name of the global endpoint.
* `replication_config` - (Optional) Parameters used for replication. Documented below.
* `role_arn` - (Optional) The ARN of the IAM role used for replication between event buses.
* `routing_config` - (Required) Parameters used for routing, including the health check and secondary Region. Documented below.

`event_bus` supports the following:

* `event_bus_arn` - (Required) The ARN of the event bus the endpoint is associated with.

`replication_config` supports the following:

* `state` - (Optional) The state of event replication. Valid values: `ENABLED`, `DISABLED`. The default state is `ENABLED`, which means you must supply a `role_arn`. If you don't have a `role_arn` or you don't want event replication enabled, set `state` to `DISABLED`.

`routing_config` support the following:

* `failover_config` - (Required) Parameters used for failover. This includes what triggers failover and what happens when it's triggered. Documented below.

`failover_config` support the following:

* `primary` - (Required) Parameters used for the primary Region. Documented below.
* `secondary` - (Required) Parameters used for the secondary Region, the Region that events are routed to when failover is triggered or event replication is enabled. Documented below.

`primary` support the following:

* `health_check` - (Required) The ARN of the health check used by the endpoint to determine whether failover is triggered.

`secondary` support the following:

* `route` - (Required) The name of the secondary Region.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - The ARN of the endpoint that was created.
* `endpoint_url` - The URL of the endpoint that was created.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import EventBridge Global Endpoints using the `name`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.cloudwatch_event_endpoint import CloudwatchEventEndpoint
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CloudwatchEventEndpoint.generate_config_for_import(self, "importedEndpoint", "example-endpoint")
```

Using `terraform import`, import EventBridge Global Endpoints using the `name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_cloudwatch_event_endpoint.imported_endpoint example-endpoint
```
