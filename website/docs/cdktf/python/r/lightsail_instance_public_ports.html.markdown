# Resource: aws_lightsail_instance_public_ports

Opens ports for a specific Amazon Lightsail instance, and specifies the IP addresses allowed to connect to the instance through the ports, and the protocol.

-> See [What is Amazon Lightsail?](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/getting-started/article/what-is-amazon-lightsail) for more information.

~> **Note:** Lightsail is currently only supported in a limited number of AWS Regions, please see ["Regions and Availability Zones in Amazon Lightsail"](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/overview/article/understanding-regions-and-availability-zones-in-amazon-lightsail) for more details.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Fn, Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.

from imports.aws.lightsail_instance import LightsailInstance
from imports.aws.lightsail_instance_public_ports import LightsailInstancePublicPorts
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        test = LightsailInstance(self, "test",
            availability_zone=Token.as_string(Fn.lookup_nested(available.names, ["0"])),
            blueprint_id="amazon_linux_2",
            bundle_id="nano_3_0",
            name="yak_sail"
        )
        aws_lightsail_instance_public_ports_test =
        LightsailInstancePublicPorts(self, "test_1",
            instance_name=test.name,
            port_info=[LightsailInstancePublicPortsPortInfo(
                from_port=80,
                protocol="tcp",
                to_port=80
            )
            ]
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_lightsail_instance_public_ports_test.override_logical_id("test")
```
