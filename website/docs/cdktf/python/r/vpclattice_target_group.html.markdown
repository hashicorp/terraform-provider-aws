# Resource: aws_vpclattice_target_group

Terraform resource for managing an AWS VPC Lattice Target Group.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.vpclattice_target_group import VpclatticeTargetGroup
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        VpclatticeTargetGroup(self, "example",
            config=VpclatticeTargetGroupConfigA(
                port=443,
                protocol="HTTPS",
                vpc_identifier=Token.as_string(aws_vpc_example.id)
            ),
            name="example",
            type="INSTANCE"
        )
```

### Basic usage with Health check

```python
# Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.vpclattice_target_group import VpclatticeTargetGroup
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        VpclatticeTargetGroup(self, "example",
            config=VpclatticeTargetGroupConfigA(
                health_check=VpclatticeTargetGroupConfigHealthCheck(
                    enabled=True,
                    health_check_interval_seconds=20,
                    health_check_timeout_seconds=10,
                    healthy_threshold_count=7,
                    matcher=VpclatticeTargetGroupConfigHealthCheckMatcher(
                        value="200-299"
                    ),
                    path="/instance",
                    port=80,
                    protocol="HTTP",
                    protocol_version="HTTP1",
                    unhealthy_threshold_count=3
                ),
                port=443,
                protocol="HTTPS",
                protocol_version="HTTP1",
                vpc_identifier=Token.as_string(aws_vpc_example.id)
            ),
            name="example",
            type="ALB"
        )
```

### Lambda

If the type is Lambda, `config` block is not supported.

```python
# Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.

from imports.aws.vpclattice_target_group import VpclatticeTargetGroup
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        VpclatticeTargetGroup(self, "example",
            name="example",
            type="LAMBDA"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the target group. The name must be unique within the account. The valid characters are a-z, 0-9, and hyphens (-). You can't use a hyphen as the first or last character, or immediately after another hyphen.
* `type` - (Required) The type of target group. Valid Values are `IP` | `LAMBDA` | `INSTANCE` | `ALB`

The following arguments are optional:

* `config` - (Optional) The target group configuration. If type is set to `LAMBDA,` this parameter should not be specified.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value mapping of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

Config (`config`) supports the following:

* `health_check` - (Optional) The health check configuration.
* `ip_address_type` - (Optional) The type of IP address used for the target group. Valid values: `IPV4` | `IPV6`
* `port` - (Required) The port on which the targets are listening.
* `protocol` - (Required) The protocol to use for routing traffic to the targets. Valid Values are `HTTP` | `HTTPS`
* `protocol_version` - (Optional) The protocol version. Valid Values are `HTTP1` | `HTTP2` | `GRPC`. Default value is `HTTP1`.
* `vpc_identifier` - (Required) The ID of the VPC.

Health Check (`health_check`) supports the following:

* `enabled` - (Optional) Indicates whether health checking is enabled. Defaults to `true`.
* `health_check_interval_seconds` - (Optional) The approximate amount of time, in seconds, between health checks of an individual target. The range is 5–300 seconds. The default is 30 seconds.
* `health_check_timeout_seconds` - (Optional) The amount of time, in seconds, to wait before reporting a target as unhealthy. The range is 1–120 seconds. The default is 5 seconds.
* `healthy_threshold_count ` - (Optional) The number of consecutive successful health checks required before considering an unhealthy target healthy. The range is 2–10. The default is 5.
* `matcher` - (Optional) The codes to use when checking for a successful response from a target. These are called _Success codes_ in the console.
    * `value` - (Optional) The HTTP codes to use when checking for a successful response from a target.
* `path` - (Optional) The destination for health checks on the targets. If the protocol version is HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2, specify a valid URI (for example, /path?query). The default path is `/`. Health checks are not supported if the protocol version is gRPC, however, you can choose HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 and specify a valid URI.
* `port` - (Optional) The port used when performing health checks on targets. The default setting is the port that a target receives traffic on.
* `protocol` - (Optional) The protocol used when performing health checks on targets. The possible protocols are `HTTP` and `HTTPS`.
* `protocol_version` - (Optional) The protocol version used when performing health checks on targets. The possible protocol versions are `HTTP1` and `HTTP2`. The default is `HTTP1`.
* `unhealthy_threshold_count` - (Optional) The number of consecutive failed health checks required before considering a target unhealthy. The range is 2–10. The default is 2.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - ARN of the target group.
* `id` - Unique identifier for the target group.
* `status` - Status of the target group.
* `tags_all` - Map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `create` - (Default `5m`)
* `delete` - (Default `5m`)

## Import

VPC Lattice Target Group can be imported using the `id`, e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_vpclattice_target_group.example tg-0c11d4dc16ed96bdb
```
