class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import enrollment status using the account ID. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.computeoptimizer_enrollment_status import ComputeoptimizerEnrollmentStatus
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        ComputeoptimizerEnrollmentStatus.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "123456789012")
```

Using `terraform import`, import enrollment status using the account ID. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_computeoptimizer_enrollment_status.example 123456789012
```
