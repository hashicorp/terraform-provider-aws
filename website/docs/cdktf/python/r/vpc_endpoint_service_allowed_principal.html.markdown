# Resource: aws_vpc_endpoint_service_allowed_principal

Provides a resource to allow a principal to discover a VPC endpoint service.

~> **NOTE on VPC Endpoint Services and VPC Endpoint Service Allowed Principals:** Terraform provides
both a standalone [VPC Endpoint Service Allowed Principal](vpc_endpoint_service_allowed_principal.html) resource
and a VPC Endpoint Service resource with an `allowed_principals` attribute. Do not use the same principal ARN in both
a VPC Endpoint Service resource and a VPC Endpoint Service Allowed Principal resource. Doing so will cause a conflict
and will overwrite the association.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```python
# Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_caller_identity import DataAwsCallerIdentity
from imports.aws.vpc_endpoint_service_allowed_principal import VpcEndpointServiceAllowedPrincipal
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        current = DataAwsCallerIdentity(self, "current")
        VpcEndpointServiceAllowedPrincipal(self, "allow_me_to_foo",
            principal_arn=Token.as_string(current.arn),
            vpc_endpoint_service_id=foo.id
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `vpc_endpoint_service_id` - (Required) The ID of the VPC endpoint service to allow permission.
* `principal_arn` - (Required) The ARN of the principal to allow permissions.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the association.
