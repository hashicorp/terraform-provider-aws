# Resource: aws_iam_group_policy_attachment

Attaches a Managed IAM Policy to an IAM group

~> **NOTE:** The usage of this resource conflicts with the `aws_iam_policy_attachment` resource and will permanently show a difference if both are defined.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.iam_group import IamGroup
from imports.aws.iam_group_policy_attachment import IamGroupPolicyAttachment
from imports.aws.iam_policy import IamPolicy
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        group = IamGroup(self, "group",
            name="test-group"
        )
        policy = IamPolicy(self, "policy",
            description="A test policy",
            name="test-policy",
            policy="{ ... policy JSON ... }"
        )
        IamGroupPolicyAttachment(self, "test-attach",
            group=group.name,
            policy_arn=policy.arn
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `group`  (Required) - The group the policy should be applied to
* `policy_arn`  (Required) - The ARN of the policy you want to apply

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports no additional attributes.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import IAM group policy attachments using the group name and policy arn separated by `/`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.iam_group_policy_attachment import IamGroupPolicyAttachment
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        IamGroupPolicyAttachment.generate_config_for_import(self, "testAttach", "test-group/arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:policy/test-policy")
```

Using `terraform import`, import IAM group policy attachments using the group name and policy arn separated by `/`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_iam_group_policy_attachment.test-attach test-group/arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:policy/test-policy
```
