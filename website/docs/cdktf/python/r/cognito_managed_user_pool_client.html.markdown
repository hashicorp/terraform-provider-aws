# Resource: aws_cognito_managed_user_pool_client

Use the `aws_cognito_user_pool_client` resource to manage a Cognito User Pool Client.

**This resource is advanced** and has special caveats to consider before use. Please read this document completely before using the resource.

Use the `aws_cognito_managed_user_pool_client` resource to manage a Cognito User Pool Client that is automatically created by an AWS service. For instance, when [configuring an OpenSearch Domain to use Cognito authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/cognito-auth.html), the OpenSearch service creates the User Pool Client during setup and removes it when it is no longer required. As a result, the `aws_cognito_managed_user_pool_client` resource does not create or delete this resource, but instead assumes management of it.

Use the [`aws_cognito_user_pool_client`](cognito_user_pool_client.html) resource to manage Cognito User Pool Clients for normal use cases.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Cognito User Pool Clients using the `id` of the Cognito User Pool and the `id` of the Cognito User Pool Client. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Using `terraform import`, import Cognito User Pool Clients using the `id` of the Cognito User Pool and the `id` of the Cognito User Pool Client. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_cognito_managed_user_pool_client.client us-west-2_abc123/3ho4ek12345678909nh3fmhpko
```
