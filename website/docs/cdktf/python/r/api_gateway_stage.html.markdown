# Resource: aws_api_gateway_stage

Manages an API Gateway Stage. A stage is a named reference to a deployment, which can be done via the [`aws_api_gateway_deployment` resource](api_gateway_deployment.html). Stages can be optionally managed further with the [`aws_api_gateway_base_path_mapping` resource](api_gateway_base_path_mapping.html), [`aws_api_gateway_domain_name` resource](api_gateway_domain_name.html), and [`aws_api_method_settings` resource](api_gateway_method_settings.html). For more information, see the [API Gateway Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-stages.html).

## Example Usage

An end-to-end example of a REST API configured with OpenAPI can be found in the [`/examples/api-gateway-rest-api-openapi` directory within the GitHub repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/tree/main/examples/api-gateway-rest-api-openapi).

```terraform
resource "aws_api_gateway_rest_api" "example" {
  body = jsonencode({
    openapi = "3.0.1"
    info = {
      title   = "example"
      version = "1.0"
    }
    paths = {
      "/path1" = {
        get = {
          x-amazon-apigateway-integration = {
            httpMethod           = "GET"
            payloadFormatVersion = "1.0"
            type                 = "HTTP_PROXY"
            uri                  = "https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  })

  name = "example"
}

resource "aws_api_gateway_deployment" "example" {
  rest_api_id = aws_api_gateway_rest_api.example.id

  triggers = {
    redeployment = sha1(jsonencode(aws_api_gateway_rest_api.example.body))
  }

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}

resource "aws_api_gateway_stage" "example" {
  deployment_id = aws_api_gateway_deployment.example.id
  rest_api_id   = aws_api_gateway_rest_api.example.id
  stage_name    = "example"
}

resource "aws_api_gateway_method_settings" "example" {
  rest_api_id = aws_api_gateway_rest_api.example.id
  stage_name  = aws_api_gateway_stage.example.stage_name
  method_path = "*/*"

  settings {
    metrics_enabled = true
    logging_level   = "INFO"
  }
}
```

### Managing the API Logging CloudWatch Log Group

API Gateway provides the ability to [enable CloudWatch API logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-logging.html). To manage the CloudWatch Log Group when this feature is enabled, the [`aws_cloudwatch_log_group` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/cloudwatch_log_group.html) can be used where the name matches the API Gateway naming convention. If the CloudWatch Log Group previously exists, import the [`aws_cloudwatch_log_group` resource into Terraform](/docs/providers/aws/r/cloudwatch_log_group.html#import) as a one time operation. You can recreate the environment without import.

-> The below configuration uses [`depends_on`](https://www.terraform.io/language/meta-arguments/depends_on) to prevent ordering issues with API Gateway automatically creating the log group first and a variable for naming consistency. Other ordering and naming methodologies may be more appropriate for your environment.

* `rest_api_id` - (Required) ID of the associated REST API
* `stage_name` - (Required) Name of the stage
* `deployment_id` - (Required) ID of the deployment that the stage points to
* `access_log_settings` - (Optional) Enables access logs for the API stage. See [Access Log Settings](#access-log-settings) below.
* `cache_cluster_enabled` - (Optional) Whether a cache cluster is enabled for the stage
* `cache_cluster_size` - (Optional) Size of the cache cluster for the stage, if enabled. Allowed values include `0.5`, `1.6`, `6.1`, `13.5`, `28.4`, `58.2`, `118` and `237`.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_api_gateway_stage` using `REST-API-ID/STAGE-NAME`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.api_gateway_stage import ApiGatewayStage
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        ApiGatewayStage.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "12345abcde/example")
```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_api_gateway_stage` using `REST-API-ID/STAGE-NAME`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_api_gateway_stage.example 12345abcde/example
```
