# Resource: aws_devicefarm_project

Provides a resource to manage AWS Device Farm Projects.

For more information about Device Farm Projects, see the AWS Documentation on
[Device Farm Projects][aws-get-project].

~> **NOTE:** AWS currently has limited regional support for Device Farm (e.g., `us-west-2`). See [AWS Device Farm endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/devicefarm.html) for information on supported regions.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.devicefarm_project import DevicefarmProject
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DevicefarmProject(self, "awesome_devices",
            name="my-device-farm"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

* `name` - (Required) The name of the project
* `default_job_timeout_minutes` - (Optional) Sets the execution timeout value (in minutes) for a project. All test runs in this project use the specified execution timeout value unless overridden when scheduling a run.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name of this project
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import DeviceFarm Projects using their ARN. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.devicefarm_project import DevicefarmProject
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DevicefarmProject.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "arn:aws:devicefarm:us-west-2:123456789012:project:4fa784c7-ccb4-4dbf-ba4f-02198320daa1")
```

Using `terraform import`, import DeviceFarm Projects using their ARN. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_devicefarm_project.example arn:aws:devicefarm:us-west-2:123456789012:project:4fa784c7-ccb4-4dbf-ba4f-02198320daa1
```
