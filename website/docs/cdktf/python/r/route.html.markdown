# Resource: aws_route

Provides a resource to create a routing table entry (a route) in a VPC routing table.

~> **NOTE on Route Tables and Routes:** Terraform currently provides both a standalone Route resource and a [Route Table](route_table.html) resource with routes defined in-line. At this time you cannot use a Route Table with in-line routes in conjunction with any Route resources. Doing so will cause a conflict of rule settings and will overwrite rules.

~> **NOTE on `gateway_id` attribute:** The AWS API is very forgiving with the resource ID passed in the `gateway_id` attribute. For example an `aws_route` resource can be created with an [`aws_nat_gateway`](nat_gateway.html) or [`aws_egress_only_internet_gateway`](egress_only_internet_gateway.html) ID specified for the `gateway_id` attribute. Specifying anything other than an [`aws_internet_gateway`](internet_gateway.html) or [`aws_vpn_gateway`](vpn_gateway.html) ID will lead to Terraform reporting a permanent diff between your configuration and recorded state, as the AWS API returns the more-specific attribute. If you are experiencing constant diffs with an `aws_route` resource, the first thing to check is that the correct attribute is being specified.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.route import Route
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        Route(self, "r",
            depends_on=[testing],
            destination_cidr_block="10.0.1.0/22",
            route_table_id="rtb-4fbb3ac4",
            vpc_peering_connection_id="pcx-45ff3dc1"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `route_table_id` - (Required) The ID of the routing table.

One of the following destination arguments must be supplied:

* `destination_cidr_block` - (Optional) The destination CIDR block.
* `destination_ipv6_cidr_block` - (Optional) The destination IPv6 CIDR block.
* `destination_prefix_list_id` - (Optional) The ID of a [managed prefix list](ec2_managed_prefix_list.html) destination.

One of the following target arguments must be supplied:

* `carrier_gateway_id` - (Optional) Identifier of a carrier gateway. This attribute can only be used when the VPC contains a subnet which is associated with a Wavelength Zone.
* `core_network_arn` - (Optional) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a core network.
* `egress_only_gateway_id` - (Optional) Identifier of a VPC Egress Only Internet Gateway.
* `gateway_id` - (Optional) Identifier of a VPC internet gateway or a virtual private gateway. Specify `local` when updating a previously [imported](#import) local route.
* `nat_gateway_id` - (Optional) Identifier of a VPC NAT gateway.
* `local_gateway_id` - (Optional) Identifier of a Outpost local gateway.
* `network_interface_id` - (Optional) Identifier of an EC2 network interface.
* `transit_gateway_id` - (Optional) Identifier of an EC2 Transit Gateway.
* `vpc_endpoint_id` - (Optional) Identifier of a VPC Endpoint.
* `vpc_peering_connection_id` - (Optional) Identifier of a VPC peering connection.

Note that the default route, mapping the VPC's CIDR block to "local", is created implicitly and cannot be specified.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

~> **NOTE:** Only the arguments that are configured (one of the above) will be exported as an attribute once the resource is created.

* `id` - Route identifier computed from the routing table identifier and route destination.
* `instance_id` - Identifier of an EC2 instance.
* `instance_owner_id` - The AWS account ID of the owner of the EC2 instance.
* `origin` - How the route was created - `CreateRouteTable`, `CreateRoute` or `EnableVgwRoutePropagation`.
* `state` - The state of the route - `active` or `blackhole`.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

- `create` - (Default `5m`)
- `update` - (Default `2m`)
- `delete` - (Default `5m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import individual routes using `ROUTETABLEID_DESTINATION`. Import [local routes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html#RouteTables) using the VPC's IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR blocks. For example:

Import a route in route table `rtb-656C65616E6F72` with an IPv4 destination CIDR of `10.42.0.0/16`:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Import a route in route table `rtb-656C65616E6F72` with an IPv6 destination CIDR of `2620:0:2d0:200::8/125`:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Import a route in route table `rtb-656C65616E6F72` with a managed prefix list destination of `pl-0570a1d2d725c16be`:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

**Using `terraform import` to import** individual routes using `ROUTETABLEID_DESTINATION`. Import [local routes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html#RouteTables) using the VPC's IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR blocks. For example:

Import a route in route table `rtb-656C65616E6F72` with an IPv4 destination CIDR of `10.42.0.0/16`:

```console
% terraform import aws_route.my_route rtb-656C65616E6F72_10.42.0.0/16
```

Import a route in route table `rtb-656C65616E6F72` with an IPv6 destination CIDR of `2620:0:2d0:200::8/125`:

```console
% terraform import aws_route.my_route rtb-656C65616E6F72_2620:0:2d0:200::8/125
```

Import a route in route table `rtb-656C65616E6F72` with a managed prefix list destination of `pl-0570a1d2d725c16be`:

```console
% terraform import aws_route.my_route rtb-656C65616E6F72_pl-0570a1d2d725c16be
```
