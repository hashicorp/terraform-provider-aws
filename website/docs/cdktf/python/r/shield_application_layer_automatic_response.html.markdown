# Resource: aws_shield_application_layer_automatic_response

Terraform resource for managing an AWS Shield Application Layer Automatic Response for automatic DDoS mitigation.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import VariableType, TerraformVariable, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_caller_identity import DataAwsCallerIdentity
from imports.aws.data_aws_partition import DataAwsPartition
from imports.aws.data_aws_region import DataAwsRegion
from imports.aws.shield_application_layer_automatic_response import ShieldApplicationLayerAutomaticResponse
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        # Terraform Variables are not always the best fit for getting inputs in the context of Terraform CDK.
        #     You can read more about this at https://cdk.tf/variables
        distribution_id = TerraformVariable(self, "distribution_id",
            description="The Cloudfront Distribution on which to enable the Application Layer Automatic Response.",
            type=VariableType.STRING
        )
        current = DataAwsCallerIdentity(self, "current")
        data_aws_partition_current = DataAwsPartition(self, "current_2")
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        data_aws_partition_current.override_logical_id("current")
        data_aws_region_current = DataAwsRegion(self, "current_3")
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        data_aws_region_current.override_logical_id("current")
        ShieldApplicationLayerAutomaticResponse(self, "example",
            action="COUNT",
            resource_arn="arn:${" + data_aws_partition_current.partition + "}:cloudfront:${" + current.account_id + "}:distribution/${" + distribution_id.value + "}"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `resource_arn` - (Required) ARN of the resource to protect (Cloudfront Distributions and ALBs only at this time).
* `action` - (Required) One of `COUNT` or `BLOCK`
