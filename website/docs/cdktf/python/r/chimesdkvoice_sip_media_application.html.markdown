# Resource: aws_chimesdkvoice_sip_media_application

A ChimeSDKVoice SIP Media Application is a managed object that passes values from a SIP rule to a target AWS Lambda function.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.chimesdkvoice_sip_media_application import ChimesdkvoiceSipMediaApplication
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        ChimesdkvoiceSipMediaApplication(self, "example",
            aws_region="us-east-1",
            endpoints=ChimesdkvoiceSipMediaApplicationEndpoints(
                lambda_arn=test.arn
            ),
            name="example-sip-media-application"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `aws_region` - (Required) The AWS Region in which the AWS Chime SDK Voice Sip Media Application is created.
* `endpoints` - (Required)  List of endpoints (Lambda Amazon Resource Names) specified for the SIP media application. Currently, only one endpoint is supported. See [`endpoints`](#endpoints).
* `name` - (Required) The name of the AWS Chime SDK Voice Sip Media Application.

The following arguments are optional:

* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value mapping of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

### `endpoints`

The endpoint assigned to the SIP media application.

* `lambda_arn` - (Required) Valid Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda function, version, or alias. The function must be created in the same AWS Region as the SIP media application.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` -  ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the AWS Chime SDK Voice Sip Media Application
* `id` - The SIP media application ID.
* `tags_all` - Map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import a ChimeSDKVoice SIP Media Application using the `id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Using `terraform import`, import a ChimeSDKVoice SIP Media Application using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_chimesdkvoice_sip_media_application.example abcdef123456
```
