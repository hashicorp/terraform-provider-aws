# Resource: aws_ram_sharing_with_organization

Manages Resource Access Manager (RAM) Resource Sharing with AWS Organizations. If you enable sharing with your organization, you can share resources without using invitations. Refer to the [AWS RAM user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/getting-started-sharing.html#getting-started-sharing-orgs) for more details.

~> **NOTE:** Use this resource to manage resource sharing within your organization, **not** the [`aws_organizations_organization`](organizations_organization.html) resource with `ram.amazonaws.com` configured in `aws_service_access_principals`.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.ram_sharing_with_organization import RamSharingWithOrganization
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        RamSharingWithOrganization(self, "example")
```

## Argument Reference

This resource does not support any arguments.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - AWS Account ID.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import the resource using the current AWS account ID. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.ram_sharing_with_organization import RamSharingWithOrganization
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        RamSharingWithOrganization.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "123456789012")
```

Using `terraform import`, import the resource using the current AWS account ID. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_ram_sharing_with_organization.example 123456789012
```
