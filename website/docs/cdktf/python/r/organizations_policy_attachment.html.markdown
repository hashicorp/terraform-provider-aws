## Example Usage

### Organization Account

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.organizations_policy_attachment import OrganizationsPolicyAttachment
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        OrganizationsPolicyAttachment(self, "account",
            policy_id=example.id,
            target_id="123456789012"
        )
```

### Organization Root

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Fn, Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.organizations_policy_attachment import OrganizationsPolicyAttachment
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        OrganizationsPolicyAttachment(self, "root",
            policy_id=example.id,
            target_id=Token.as_string(
                Fn.lookup_nested(aws_organizations_organization_example.roots, ["0", "id"]))
        )
```

### Organization Unit

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.organizations_policy_attachment import OrganizationsPolicyAttachment
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        OrganizationsPolicyAttachment(self, "unit",
            policy_id=example.id,
            target_id=Token.as_string(aws_organizations_organizational_unit_example.id)
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `policy_id` - (Required) The unique identifier (ID) of the policy that you want to attach to the target.
* `target_id` - (Required) The unique identifier (ID) of the root, organizational unit, or account number that you want to attach the policy to.
* `skip_destroy` - (Optional) If set to `true`, destroy will **not** detach the policy and instead just remove the resource from state. This can be useful in situations where the attachment must be preserved to meet the AWS minimum requirement of 1 attached policy.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports no additional attributes.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_organizations_policy_attachment` using the target ID and policy ID. For example:

With an account target:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.organizations_policy_attachment import OrganizationsPolicyAttachment
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        OrganizationsPolicyAttachment.generate_config_for_import(self, "account", "123456789012:p-12345678")
```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_organizations_policy_attachment` using the target ID and policy ID. For example:

With an account target:

```console
% terraform import aws_organizations_policy_attachment.account 123456789012:p-12345678
```
