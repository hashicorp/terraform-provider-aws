from imports.aws.chime_voice_connector_origination import ChimeVoiceConnectorOrigination
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        default_var = ChimeVoiceConnector(self, "default",

        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `voice_connector_id` - (Required) The Amazon Chime Voice Connector ID.
* `route` - (Required) Set of call distribution properties defined for your SIP hosts. See [route](#route) below for more details. Minimum of 1. Maximum of 20.
* `disabled` - (Optional) When origination settings are disabled, inbound calls are not enabled for your Amazon Chime Voice Connector.

### `route`

Origination routes define call distribution properties for your SIP hosts to receive inbound calls using your Amazon Chime Voice Connector. Limit: Ten origination routes for each Amazon Chime Voice Connector.

* `host` - (Required) The FQDN or IP address to contact for origination traffic.
* `port` - (Required) The designated origination route port. Defaults to `5060`.
* `priority` - (Required) The priority associated with the host, with 1 being the highest priority. Higher priority hosts are attempted first.
* `protocol` - (Required) The protocol to use for the origination route. Encryption-enabled Amazon Chime Voice Connectors use TCP protocol by default.
* `weight` - (Required) The weight associated with the host. If hosts are equal in priority, calls are redistributed among them based on their relative weight.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The Amazon Chime Voice Connector ID.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Chime Voice Connector Origination using the `voice_connector_id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.chime_voice_connector_origination import ChimeVoiceConnectorOrigination
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        ChimeVoiceConnectorOrigination.generate_config_for_import(self, "default", "abcdef1ghij2klmno3pqr4")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Chime Voice Connector Origination using the `voice_connector_id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_chime_voice_connector_origination.default abcdef1ghij2klmno3pqr4
```
