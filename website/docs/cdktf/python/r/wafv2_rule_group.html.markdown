## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `capacity` - (Required, Forces new resource) The web ACL capacity units (WCUs) required for this rule group. See [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/APIReference/API_CreateRuleGroup.html#API_CreateRuleGroup_RequestSyntax) for general information and [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statements-list.html) for capacity specific information.
* `custom_response_body` - (Optional) Defines custom response bodies that can be referenced by `custom_response` actions. See [Custom Response Body](#custom-response-body) below for details.
* `description` - (Optional) A friendly description of the rule group.
* `name` - (Required, Forces new resource) A friendly name of the rule group.
* `rule` - (Optional) The rule blocks used to identify the web requests that you want to `allow`, `block`, or `count`. See [Rules](#rules) below for details.
* `scope` - (Required, Forces new resource) Specifies whether this is for an AWS CloudFront distribution or for a regional application. Valid values are `CLOUDFRONT` or `REGIONAL`. To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the region `us-east-1` (N. Virginia) on the AWS provider.
* `tags` - (Optional) An array of key:value pairs to associate with the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `visibility_config` - (Required) Defines and enables Amazon CloudWatch metrics and web request sample collection. See [Visibility Configuration](#visibility-configuration) below for details.

### Custom Response Body

Each `custom_response_body` block supports the following arguments:

* `key` - (Required) A unique key identifying the custom response body. This is referenced by the `custom_response_body_key` argument in the [Custom Response](#custom-response) block.
* `content` - (Required) The payload of the custom response.
* `content_type` - (Required) The type of content in the payload that you are defining in the `content` argument. Valid values are `TEXT_PLAIN`, `TEXT_HTML`, or `APPLICATION_JSON`.

### Rules

Each `rule` supports the following arguments:

* `action` - (Required) The action that AWS WAF should take on a web request when it matches the rule's statement. Settings at the `aws_wafv2_web_acl` level can override the rule action setting. See [Action](#action) below for details.

* `text_transformation`: Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. They are used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. Atleast one transformation is required.  See [Text Transformation](#text-transformation) above for details.

### RateLimit `forwarded_ip` Block

Use the first IP address in an HTTP header as an aggregate key. Each distinct forwarded IP address contributes to the aggregation instance. When you specify an IP or forwarded IP in the custom key settings, you must also specify at least one other key to use. You can aggregate on only the forwarded IP address by specifying `FORWARDED_IP` in your rate-based statement's `aggregate_key_type`. With this option, you must specify the header to use in the rate-based rule's [Forwarded IP Config](#forwarded-ip-config) block.

The `forwarded_ip` block is configured as an empty block `{}`.

### RateLimit `http_method` Block

Use the request's HTTP method as an aggregate key. Each distinct HTTP method contributes to the aggregation instance. If you use just the HTTP method as your custom key, then each method fully defines an aggregation instance.

The `http_method` block is configured as an empty block `{}`.

### RateLimit `header` Block

Use the value of a header in the request as an aggregate key. Each distinct value in the header contributes to the aggregation instance. If you use a single header as your custom key, then each value fully defines an aggregation instance.

The `header` block supports the following arguments:

* `name`: The name of the header to use.
* `text_transformation`: Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. They are used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. Atleast one transformation is required.  See [Text Transformation](#text-transformation) above for details.

### RateLimit `ip` Block

Use the request's originating IP address as an aggregate key. Each distinct IP address contributes to the aggregation instance. When you specify an IP or forwarded IP in the custom key settings, you must also specify at least one other key to use. You can aggregate on only the IP address by specifying `IP` in your rate-based statement's `aggregate_key_type`.

The `ip` block is configured as an empty block `{}`.

### RateLimit `label_namespace` Block

Use the specified label namespace as an aggregate key. Each distinct fully qualified label name that has the specified label namespace contributes to the aggregation instance. If you use just one label namespace as your custom key, then each label name fully defines an aggregation instance. This uses only labels that have been added to the request by rules that are evaluated before this rate-based rule in the web ACL. For information about label namespaces and names, see Label syntax and naming requirements (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-label-requirements.html) in the WAF Developer Guide.

The `label_namespace` block supports the following arguments:

* `namespace`: The namespace to use for aggregation

### RateLimit `query_argument` Block

Use the specified query argument as an aggregate key. Each distinct value for the named query argument contributes to the aggregation instance. If you use a single query argument as your custom key, then each value fully defines an aggregation instance.

The `query_argument` block supports the following arguments:

* `name`: The name of the query argument to use.
* `text_transformation`: Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. They are used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. Atleast one transformation is required. See [Text Transformation](#text-transformation) above for details.

### RateLimit `query_string` Block

Use the request's query string as an aggregate key. Each distinct string contributes to the aggregation instance. If you use just the query string as your custom key, then each string fully defines an aggregation instance.

The `query_string` block supports the following arguments:

* `text_transformation`: Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. They are used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. Atleast one transformation is required. See [Text Transformation](#text-transformation) above for details.

### RateLimit `uri_path` Block

Use the request's URI path as an aggregate key. Each distinct URI path contributes to the aggregation instance. If you use just the URI path as your custom key, then each URI path fully defines an aggregation instance.

The `uri_path` block supports the following arguments:

* `text_transformation`: Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. They are used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. Atleast one transformation is required. See [Text Transformation](#text-transformation) above for details.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import WAFv2 Rule Group using `ID/name/scope`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.wafv2_rule_group import Wafv2RuleGroup
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        Wafv2RuleGroup.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "a1b2c3d4-d5f6-7777-8888-9999aaaabbbbcccc/example/REGIONAL")
```

Using `terraform import`, import WAFv2 Rule Group using `ID/name/scope`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_wafv2_rule_group.example a1b2c3d4-d5f6-7777-8888-9999aaaabbbbcccc/example/REGIONAL
```
