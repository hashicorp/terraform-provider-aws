# Resource: aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule

Manages an inbound (ingress) rule for a security group.

When specifying an inbound rule for your security group in a VPC, the configuration must include a source for the traffic.

~> **NOTE on Security Groups and Security Group Rules:** Terraform currently provides a [Security Group resource](security_group.html) with `ingress` and `egress` rules defined in-line and a [Security Group Rule resource](security_group_rule.html) which manages one or more `ingress` or
`egress` rules. Both of these resource were added before AWS assigned a [security group rule unique ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-rules.html), and they do not work well in all scenarios using the`description` and `tags` attributes, which rely on the unique ID.
The `aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule` resource has been added to address these limitations and should be used for all new security group rules.
You should not use the `aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule` resource in conjunction with an `aws_security_group` resource with in-line rules or with `aws_security_group_rule` resources defined for the same Security Group, as rule conflicts may occur and rules will be overwritten.

from imports.aws.security_group import SecurityGroup
from imports.aws.vpc_security_group_ingress_rule import VpcSecurityGroupIngressRule
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = SecurityGroup(self, "example",
            description="example",
            name="example",
            tags={
                "Name": "example"
            },
            vpc_id=main.id
        )
        aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule_example =
        VpcSecurityGroupIngressRule(self, "example_1",
            cidr_ipv4="10.0.0.0/8",
            from_port=80,
            ip_protocol="tcp",
            security_group_id=example.id,
            to_port=80
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

~> **Note** Although `cidr_ipv4`, `cidr_ipv6`, `prefix_list_id`, and `referenced_security_group_id` are all marked as optional, you *must* provide one of them in order to configure the destination of the traffic. The `from_port` and `to_port` arguments are required unless `ip_protocol` is set to `-1` or `icmpv6`.

* `cidr_ipv4` - (Optional) The source IPv4 CIDR range.
* `cidr_ipv6` - (Optional) The source IPv6 CIDR range.
* `description` - (Optional) The security group rule description.
* `from_port` - (Optional) The start of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP/ICMPv6 type.
* `ip_protocol` - (Required) The IP protocol name or number. Use `-1` to specify all protocols. Note that if `ip_protocol` is set to `-1`, it translates to all protocols, all port ranges, and `from_port` and `to_port` values should not be defined.
* `prefix_list_id` - (Optional) The ID of the source prefix list.
* `referenced_security_group_id` - (Optional) The source security group that is referenced in the rule.
* `security_group_id` - (Required) The ID of the security group.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `to_port` - (Optional) The end of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP/ICMPv6 code.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the security group rule.
* `security_group_rule_id` - The ID of the security group rule.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import security group ingress rules using the `security_group_rule_id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.vpc_security_group_ingress_rule import VpcSecurityGroupIngressRule
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        VpcSecurityGroupIngressRule.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "sgr-02108b27edd666983")
```

Using `terraform import`, import security group ingress rules using the `security_group_rule_id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule.example sgr-02108b27edd666983
```
