# Resource: aws_s3_bucket_inventory

Provides a S3 bucket [inventory configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-inventory.html) resource.

-> This resource cannot be used with S3 directory buckets.

## Example Usage

### Add inventory configuration

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.s3_bucket import S3Bucket
from imports.aws.s3_bucket_inventory import S3BucketInventory
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        inventory = S3Bucket(self, "inventory",
            bucket="my-tf-inventory-bucket"
        )
        test = S3Bucket(self, "test",
            bucket="my-tf-test-bucket"
        )
        aws_s3_bucket_inventory_test = S3BucketInventory(self, "test_2",
            bucket=test.id,
            destination=S3BucketInventoryDestination(
                bucket=S3BucketInventoryDestinationBucket(
                    bucket_arn=inventory.arn,
                    format="ORC"
                )
            ),
            included_object_versions="All",
            name="EntireBucketDaily",
            schedule=S3BucketInventorySchedule(
                frequency="Daily"
            )
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_s3_bucket_inventory_test.override_logical_id("test")
```

### Add inventory configuration with S3 object prefix

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.

class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        inventory = S3Bucket(self, "inventory",
            bucket="my-tf-inventory-bucket"
        )
        test = S3Bucket(self, "test",
            bucket="my-tf-test-bucket"
        )
        S3BucketInventory(self, "test-prefix",
            bucket=test.id,
            destination=S3BucketInventoryDestination(
                bucket=S3BucketInventoryDestinationBucket(
                    bucket_arn=inventory.arn,
                    format="ORC",
                    prefix="inventory"
                )
            ),
            filter=S3BucketInventoryFilter(
                prefix="documents/"
            ),
            included_object_versions="All",
            name="DocumentsWeekly",
            schedule=S3BucketInventorySchedule(
                frequency="Daily"
            )
        )

This resource exports no additional attributes.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import S3 bucket inventory configurations using `bucket:inventory`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.s3_bucket_inventory import S3BucketInventory
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        S3BucketInventory.generate_config_for_import(self, "myBucketEntireBucket", "my-bucket:EntireBucket")
```

Using `terraform import`, import S3 bucket inventory configurations using `bucket:inventory`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_inventory.my-bucket-entire-bucket my-bucket:EntireBucket
```
