## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `control_panel_arn` - (Required) ARN of the control panel in which this safety rule will reside.
* `name` - (Required) Name describing the safety rule.
* `rule_config` - (Required) Configuration block for safety rule criteria. See below.
* `wait_period_ms` - (Required) Evaluation period, in milliseconds (ms), during which any request against the target routing controls will fail.

The following arguments are optional:

* `asserted_controls` - (Optional) Routing controls that are part of transactions that are evaluated to determine if a request to change a routing control state is allowed.
* `gating_controls` - (Optional) Gating controls for the new gating rule. That is, routing controls that are evaluated by the rule configuration that you specify.
* `target_controls` - (Optional) Routing controls that can only be set or unset if the specified `rule_config` evaluates to true for the specified `gating_controls`.

### rule_config

* `inverted` - (Required) Logical negation of the rule.
* `threshold` - (Required) Number of controls that must be set when you specify an `ATLEAST` type rule.
* `type` - (Required) Rule type. Valid values are `ATLEAST`, `AND`, and `OR`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - ARN of the safety rule.
* `status` - Status of the safety rule. `PENDING` when it is being created/updated, `PENDING_DELETION` when it is being deleted, and `DEPLOYED` otherwise.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Route53 Recovery Control Config Safety Rule using the safety rule ARN. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Using `terraform import`, import Route53 Recovery Control Config Safety Rule using the safety rule ARN. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_route53recoverycontrolconfig_safety_rule.myrule arn:aws:route53-recovery-control::313517334327:controlpanel/1bfba17df8684f5dab0467b71424f7e8/safetyrule/3bacc77003364c0f
```
