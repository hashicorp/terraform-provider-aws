# Resource: aws_grafana_workspace_service_account_token

-> **Note:** You cannot update a service account token. If you change any attribute, Terraform
will delete the current and create a new one.

Read about Service Accounts Tokens in the [Amazon Managed Grafana user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/grafana/latest/userguide/service-accounts.html#service-account-tokens).

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws. import GrafanaWorkspaceServiceAccount, GrafanaWorkspaceServiceAccountToken
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = GrafanaWorkspaceServiceAccount(self, "example",
            grafana_role="ADMIN",
            name="example-admin",
            workspace_id=aws_grafana_workspace_example.id
        )
        aws_grafana_workspace_service_account_token_example =
        GrafanaWorkspaceServiceAccountToken(self, "example_1",
            name="example-key",
            seconds_to_live=3600,
            service_account_id=example.service_account_id,
            workspace_id=aws_grafana_workspace_example.id
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_grafana_workspace_service_account_token_example.override_logical_id("example")
```
