from imports.aws.amplify_app import AmplifyApp
from imports.aws.amplify_branch import AmplifyBranch
from imports.aws.amplify_webhook import AmplifyWebhook
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = AmplifyApp(self, "example",
            name="app"
        )
        master = AmplifyBranch(self, "master",
            app_id=example.id,
            branch_name="master"
        )
        aws_amplify_webhook_master = AmplifyWebhook(self, "master_2",
            app_id=example.id,
            branch_name=master.branch_name,
            description="triggermaster"
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_amplify_webhook_master.override_logical_id("master")
```

* `app_id` - (Required) Unique ID for an Amplify app.
* `branch_name` - (Required) Name for a branch that is part of the Amplify app.
* `description` - (Optional) Description for a webhook.

## Attribute Reference

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Amplify webhook using a webhook ID. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.amplify_webhook import AmplifyWebhook
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        AmplifyWebhook.generate_config_for_import(self, "master", "a26b22a0-748b-4b57-b9a0-ae7e601fe4b1")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Amplify webhook using a webhook ID. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_amplify_webhook.master a26b22a0-748b-4b57-b9a0-ae7e601fe4b1
```
