```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.cloudwatch_dashboard import CloudwatchDashboard
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CloudwatchDashboard.generate_config_for_import(self, "sample", "dashboard_name")
```

Using `terraform import`, import CloudWatch dashboards using the `dashboard_name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_cloudwatch_dashboard.sample dashboard_name
```
