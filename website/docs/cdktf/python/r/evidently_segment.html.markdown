# Resource: aws_evidently_segment

Provides a CloudWatch Evidently Segment resource.

## Example Usage

### Basic

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.evidently_segment import EvidentlySegment
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        EvidentlySegment(self, "example",
            name="example",
            pattern="{\\\"Price\\\":[{\\\"numeric\\\":[\\\">\\\",10,\\\"<=\\\",20]}]}",
            tags={
                "Key1": "example Segment"
            }
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `description` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Specifies the description of the segment.
* `name` - (Required, Forces new resource) A name for the segment.
* `pattern` - (Required, Forces new resource) The pattern to use for the segment. For more information about pattern syntax, see [Segment rule pattern syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Evidently-segments.html#CloudWatch-Evidently-segments-syntax.html).
* `tags` - (Optional) Tags to apply to the segment. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - The ARN of the segment.
* `created_time` - The date and time that the segment is created.
* `experiment_count` - The number of experiments that this segment is used in. This count includes all current experiments, not just those that are currently running.
* `id` - The ID has the same value as the ARN of the segment.
* `last_updated_time` - The date and time that this segment was most recently updated.
* `launch_count` - The number of launches that this segment is used in. This count includes all current launches, not just those that are currently running.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import CloudWatch Evidently Segment using the `arn`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.evidently_segment import EvidentlySegment
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        EvidentlySegment.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "arn:aws:evidently:us-west-2:123456789012:segment/example")
```

Using `terraform import`, import CloudWatch Evidently Segment using the `arn`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_evidently_segment.example arn:aws:evidently:us-west-2:123456789012:segment/example
```
