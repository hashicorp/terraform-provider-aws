# Resource: aws_lexv2models_bot

Terraform resource for managing an AWS Lex V2 Models Bot.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Fn, Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.iam_role import IamRole
from imports.aws.lexv2_models_bot import Lexv2ModelsBot
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = IamRole(self, "example",
            assume_role_policy=Token.as_string(
                Fn.jsonencode({
                    "Statement": [{
                        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
                        "Effect": "Allow",
                        "Principal": {
                            "Service": "lexv2.amazonaws.com"
                        },
                        "Sid": ""
                    }

            name="example",
            tags={
                "created_by": "aws"
            }
        )
        aws_lexv2_models_bot_example = Lexv2ModelsBot(self, "example_1",
            data_privacy=[{
                "child_directed": False
            }
            ],
            description="Example description",
            idle_session_ttl_in_seconds=60,
            name="example",
            role_arn=example.arn,
            tags={
                "foo": "bar"
            },
            type="Bot"
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_lexv2_models_bot_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Lex V2 Models Bot using the `id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.lexv2_models_bot import Lexv2ModelsBot
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        Lexv2ModelsBot.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "bot-id-12345678")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Lex V2 Models Bot using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_lexv2models_bot.example bot-id-12345678
```
