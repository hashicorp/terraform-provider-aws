from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.iot_thing import IotThing
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        IotThing(self, "example",
            attributes={
                "First": "examplevalue"
            },
            name="example"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

* `name` - (Required) The name of the thing.
* `attributes` - (Optional) Map of attributes of the thing.
* `thing_type_name` - (Optional) The thing type name.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `default_client_id` - The default client ID.
* `version` - The current version of the thing record in the registry.
* `arn` - The ARN of the thing.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import IOT Things using the name. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.iot_thing import IotThing
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        IotThing.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "example")
```

Using `terraform import`, import IOT Things using the name. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_iot_thing.example example
```
