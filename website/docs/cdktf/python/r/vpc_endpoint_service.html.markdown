# Resource: aws_vpc_endpoint_service

Provides a VPC Endpoint Service resource.
Service consumers can create an _Interface_ [VPC Endpoint](vpc_endpoint.html) to connect to the service.

~> **NOTE on VPC Endpoint Services and VPC Endpoint Service Allowed Principals:** Terraform provides
both a standalone [VPC Endpoint Service Allowed Principal](vpc_endpoint_service_allowed_principal.html) resource
and a VPC Endpoint Service resource with an `allowed_principals` attribute. Do not use the same principal ARN in both
a VPC Endpoint Service resource and a VPC Endpoint Service Allowed Principal resource. Doing so will cause a conflict
and will overwrite the association.

## Example Usage

### Network Load Balancers

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.vpc_endpoint_service import VpcEndpointService
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        VpcEndpointService(self, "example",
            acceptance_required=False,
            network_load_balancer_arns=[Token.as_string(aws_lb_example.arn)]
        )
```

### Gateway Load Balancers

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.vpc_endpoint_service import VpcEndpointService
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        VpcEndpointService(self, "example",
            acceptance_required=False,
            gateway_load_balancer_arns=[Token.as_string(aws_lb_example.arn)]
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `acceptance_required` - (Required) Whether or not VPC endpoint connection requests to the service must be accepted by the service owner - `true` or `false`.
* `allowed_principals` - (Optional) The ARNs of one or more principals allowed to discover the endpoint service.
* `gateway_load_balancer_arns` - (Optional) Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of one or more Gateway Load Balancers for the endpoint service.
* `network_load_balancer_arns` - (Optional) Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of one or more Network Load Balancers for the endpoint service.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `private_dns_name` - (Optional) The private DNS name for the service.
* `supported_ip_address_types` - (Optional) The supported IP address types. The possible values are `ipv4` and `ipv6`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The ID of the VPC endpoint service.
* `availability_zones` - A set of Availability Zones in which the service is available.
* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the VPC endpoint service.
* `base_endpoint_dns_names` - A set of DNS names for the service.
* `manages_vpc_endpoints` - Whether or not the service manages its VPC endpoints - `true` or `false`.
* `service_name` - The service name.
* `service_type` - The service type, `Gateway` or `Interface`.
* `state` - The state of the VPC endpoint service.
* `private_dns_name_configuration` - List of objects containing information about the endpoint service private DNS name configuration.
    * `name` - Name of the record subdomain the service provider needs to create.
    * `state` - Verification state of the VPC endpoint service. Consumers of the endpoint service can use the private name only when the state is `verified`.
    * `type` - Endpoint service verification type, for example `TXT`.
    * `value` - Value the service provider adds to the private DNS name domain record before verification.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import VPC Endpoint Services using the VPC endpoint service `id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Using `terraform import`, import VPC Endpoint Services using the VPC endpoint service `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_vpc_endpoint_service.foo vpce-svc-0f97a19d3fa8220bc
```
