## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Direct Connect Gateways using the gateway `id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.dx_gateway import DxGateway
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DxGateway.generate_config_for_import(self, "test", "abcd1234-dcba-5678-be23-cdef9876ab45")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Direct Connect Gateways using the gateway `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_dx_gateway.test abcd1234-dcba-5678-be23-cdef9876ab45
```
