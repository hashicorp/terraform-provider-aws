# Resource: aws_codeconnections_connection

Terraform resource for managing an AWS CodeConnections Connection.

~> **NOTE:** The `aws_codeconnections_connection` resource is created in the state `PENDING`. Authentication with the connection provider must be completed in the AWS Console. See the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/connections-update.html) for details.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.codeconnections_connection import CodeconnectionsConnection
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CodeconnectionsConnection(self, "example",
            name="example-connection",
            provider_type="Bitbucket"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the connection to be created. The name must be unique in the calling AWS account. Changing `name` will create a new resource.
* `provider_type` - (Optional) The name of the external provider where your third-party code repository is configured. Changing `provider_type` will create a new resource. Conflicts with `host_arn`.
* `host_arn` - (Optional) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the host associated with the connection. Conflicts with `provider_type`
* `tags` - (Optional) Map of key-value resource tags to associate with the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The codeconnections connection ARN.
* `arn` - The codeconnections connection ARN.
* `connection_status` - The codeconnections connection status. Possible values are `PENDING`, `AVAILABLE` and `ERROR`.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import CodeConnections connection using the ARN. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.codeconnections_connection import CodeconnectionsConnection
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CodeconnectionsConnection.generate_config_for_import(self, "testConnection", "arn:aws:codeconnections:us-west-1:0123456789:connection/79d4d357-a2ee-41e4-b350-2fe39ae59448")
```

Using `terraform import`, import CodeConnections connection using the ARN. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_codeconnections_connection.test-connection arn:aws:codeconnections:us-west-1:0123456789:connection/79d4d357-a2ee-41e4-b350-2fe39ae59448
```
