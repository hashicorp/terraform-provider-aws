## Example Usage

```python

from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.

from imports.aws.detective_graph import DetectiveGraph
from imports.aws.detective_member import DetectiveMember
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = DetectiveGraph(self, "example")
        aws_detective_member_example = DetectiveMember(self, "example_1",
            account_id="AWS ACCOUNT ID",
            disable_email_notification=True,
            email_address="EMAIL",
            graph_arn=example.id,
            message="Message of the invitation"
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_detective_member_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `account_id` - (Required) AWS account ID for the account.
* `email_address` - (Required) Email address for the account.
* `graph_arn` - (Required) ARN of the behavior graph to invite the member accounts to contribute their data to.
* `message` - (Optional) A custom message to include in the invitation. Amazon Detective adds this message to the standard content that it sends for an invitation.
* `disable_email_notification` - (Optional) If set to true, then the root user of the invited account will _not_ receive an email notification. This notification is in addition to an alert that the root user receives in AWS Personal Health Dashboard. By default, this is set to `false`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - Unique identifier (ID) of the Detective.
* `status` - Current membership status of the member account.
* `administrator_id` - AWS account ID for the administrator account.
* `volume_usage_in_bytes` - Data volume in bytes per day for the member account.
* `invited_time` - Date and time, in UTC and extended RFC 3339 format, when an Amazon Detective membership invitation was last sent to the account.
* `updated_time` - Date and time, in UTC and extended RFC 3339 format, of the most recent change to the member account's status.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_detective_member` using the ARN of the graph followed by the account ID of the member account. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_detective_member` using the ARN of the graph followed by the account ID of the member account. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_detective_member.example arn:aws:detective:us-east-1:123456789101:graph:231684d34gh74g4bae1dbc7bd807d02d/123456789012
```
