# Resource: aws_apigatewayv2_deployment

Manages an Amazon API Gateway Version 2 deployment.
More information can be found in the [Amazon API Gateway Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-websocket-api.html).

-> **Note:** Creating a deployment for an API requires at least one `aws_apigatewayv2_route` resource associated with that API. To avoid race conditions when all resources are being created together, you need to add implicit resource references via the `triggers` argument or explicit resource references using the [resource `depends_on` meta-argument](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/meta-arguments/depends_on.html).

-> Enable the [resource `lifecycle` configuration block `create_before_destroy` argument](https://www.terraform.io/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#create_before_destroy) in this resource configuration to properly order redeployments in Terraform.

## Example Usage

### Basic

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from cdktf import TerraformResourceLifecycle
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.apigatewayv2_deployment import Apigatewayv2Deployment
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        Apigatewayv2Deployment(self, "example",
            api_id=Token.as_string(aws_apigatewayv2_api_example.id),
            description="Example deployment",
            lifecycle=TerraformResourceLifecycle(
                create_before_destroy=True
            )
        )
```

### Redeployment Triggers

-> **NOTE:** This is an optional and Terraform 0.12 (or later) advanced configuration that shows calculating a hash of the API's Terraform resources to determine changes that should trigger a new deployment. This value will change after the first Terraform apply of new resources, triggering an immediate redeployment, however it will stabilize afterwards except for resource changes. The `triggers` map can also be configured in other, more complex ways to fit the environment, avoiding the immediate redeployment issue.

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from cdktf import TerraformResourceLifecycle
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, Fn, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.apigatewayv2_deployment import Apigatewayv2Deployment
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        Apigatewayv2Deployment(self, "example",
            api_id=Token.as_string(aws_apigatewayv2_api_example.id),
            description="Example deployment",
            lifecycle=TerraformResourceLifecycle(
                create_before_destroy=True
            ),
            triggers={
                "redeployment": Token.as_string(
                    Fn.sha1(
                        Token.as_string(
                            Fn.join(",",
                                Token.as_list(
                                    Fn.tolist([
                                        Fn.jsonencode(aws_apigatewayv2_integration_example),
                                        Fn.jsonencode(aws_apigatewayv2_route_example)
                                    ]))))))
            }
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `api_id` - (Required) API identifier.
* `description` - (Optional) Description for the deployment resource. Must be less than or equal to 1024 characters in length.
* `triggers` - (Optional) Map of arbitrary keys and values that, when changed, will trigger a redeployment. To force a redeployment without changing these keys/values, use the [`terraform taint` command](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/taint.html).

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - Deployment identifier.
* `auto_deployed` - Whether the deployment was automatically released.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_apigatewayv2_deployment` using the API identifier and deployment identifier. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_apigatewayv2_deployment` using the API identifier and deployment identifier. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_apigatewayv2_deployment.example aabbccddee/1122334
```

The `triggers` argument cannot be imported.
