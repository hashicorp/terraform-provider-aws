# Resource: aws_network_acl

Provides an network ACL resource. You might set up network ACLs with rules similar
to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC.

~> **NOTE on Network ACLs and Network ACL Rules:** Terraform currently
provides both a standalone [Network ACL Rule](network_acl_rule.html) resource and a Network ACL resource with rules
defined in-line. At this time you cannot use a Network ACL with in-line rules
in conjunction with any Network ACL Rule resources. Doing so will cause
a conflict of rule settings and will overwrite rules.

~> **NOTE on Network ACLs and Network ACL Associations:** Terraform provides both a standalone [network ACL association](network_acl_association.html)
resource and a network ACL resource with a `subnet_ids` attribute. Do not use the same subnet ID in both a network ACL
resource and a network ACL association resource. Doing so will cause a conflict of associations and will overwrite the association.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.network_acl import NetworkAcl
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        NetworkAcl(self, "main",
            egress=[NetworkAclEgress(
                action="allow",
                cidr_block="10.3.0.0/18",
                from_port=443,
                protocol="tcp",
                rule_no=200,
                to_port=443
            )
            ],
            ingress=[NetworkAclIngress(
                action="allow",
                cidr_block="10.3.0.0/18",
                from_port=80,
                protocol="tcp",
                rule_no=100,
                to_port=80
            )
            ],
            tags={
                "Name": "main"
            },
            vpc_id=Token.as_string(aws_vpc_main.id)
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `vpc_id` - (Required) The ID of the associated VPC.
* `subnet_ids` - (Optional) A list of Subnet IDs to apply the ACL to
* `ingress` - (Optional) Specifies an ingress rule. Parameters defined below.
  This argument is processed in [attribute-as-blocks mode](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/attr-as-blocks.html).
* `egress` - (Optional) Specifies an egress rule. Parameters defined below.
  This argument is processed in [attribute-as-blocks mode](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/attr-as-blocks.html).
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

### egress and ingress

Both arguments are processed in [attribute-as-blocks mode](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/attr-as-blocks.html).

Both `egress` and `ingress` support the following keys:

* `from_port` - (Required) The from port to match.
* `to_port` - (Required) The to port to match.
* `rule_no` - (Required) The rule number. Used for ordering.
* `action` - (Required) The action to take.
* `protocol` - (Required) The protocol to match. If using the -1 'all'
protocol, you must specify a from and to port of 0.
* `cidr_block` - (Optional) The CIDR block to match. This must be a
valid network mask.
* `ipv6_cidr_block` - (Optional) The IPv6 CIDR block.
* `icmp_type` - (Optional) The ICMP type to be used. Default 0.
* `icmp_code` - (Optional) The ICMP type code to be used. Default 0.

~> Note: For more information on ICMP types and codes, see here: https://www.iana.org/assignments/icmp-parameters/icmp-parameters.xhtml

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The ID of the network ACL
* `arn` - The ARN of the network ACL
* `owner_id` - The ID of the AWS account that owns the network ACL.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Network ACLs using the `id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.network_acl import NetworkAcl
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        NetworkAcl.generate_config_for_import(self, "main", "acl-7aaabd18")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Network ACLs using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_network_acl.main acl-7aaabd18
```
