# Resource: aws_cloudhsm_v2_cluster

Creates an Amazon CloudHSM v2 cluster.

For information about CloudHSM v2, see the
[AWS CloudHSM User Guide][1] and the [Amazon
CloudHSM API Reference][2].

~> **NOTE:** A CloudHSM Cluster can take several minutes to set up.
Practically no single attribute can be updated, except for `tags`.
If you need to delete a cluster, you have to remove its HSM modules first.
To initialize cluster, you have to add an HSM instance to the cluster, then sign CSR and upload it.

## Example Usage

The following example below creates a CloudHSM cluster.

```python

        # In most cases loops should be handled in the programming language context and
        #     not inside of the Terraform context. If you are looping over something external, e.g. a variable or a file input
        #     you should consider using a for loop. If you are looping over something only known to Terraform, e.g. a result of a data source
        #     you need to keep this like it is.

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `source_backup_identifier` - (Optional) ID of Cloud HSM v2 cluster backup to be restored.
* `hsm_type` - (Required) The type of HSM module in the cluster. Currently, only `hsm1.medium` is supported.
* `subnet_ids` - (Required) The IDs of subnets in which cluster will operate.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `cluster_id` - The id of the CloudHSM cluster.
* `cluster_state` - The state of the CloudHSM cluster.
* `vpc_id` - The id of the VPC that the CloudHSM cluster resides in.
* `security_group_id` - The ID of the security group associated with the CloudHSM cluster.
* `cluster_certificates` - The list of cluster certificates.
    * `cluster_certificates.0.cluster_certificate` - The cluster certificate issued (signed) by the issuing certificate authority (CA) of the cluster's owner.
    * `cluster_certificates.0.cluster_csr` - The certificate signing request (CSR). Available only in `UNINITIALIZED` state after an HSM instance is added to the cluster.
    * `cluster_certificates.0.aws_hardware_certificate` - The HSM hardware certificate issued (signed) by AWS CloudHSM.
    * `cluster_certificates.0.hsm_certificate` - The HSM certificate issued (signed) by the HSM hardware.
    * `cluster_certificates.0.manufacturer_hardware_certificate` - The HSM hardware certificate issued (signed) by the hardware manufacturer.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import CloudHSM v2 Clusters using the cluster `id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.cloudhsm_v2_cluster import CloudhsmV2Cluster
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CloudhsmV2Cluster.generate_config_for_import(self, "testCluster", "cluster-aeb282a201")
```

Using `terraform import`, import CloudHSM v2 Clusters using the cluster `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_cloudhsm_v2_cluster.test_cluster cluster-aeb282a201
```
