## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import  Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall domain lists using the Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall domain list ID. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.route53_resolver_firewall_domain_list import Route53ResolverFirewallDomainList
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        Route53ResolverFirewallDomainList.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "rslvr-fdl-0123456789abcdef")
```

Using `terraform import`, import  Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall domain lists using the Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall domain list ID. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_route53_resolver_firewall_domain_list.example rslvr-fdl-0123456789abcdef
```
