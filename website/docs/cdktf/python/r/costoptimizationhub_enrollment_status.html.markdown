# Resource: aws_costoptimizationhub_enrollment_status

Terraform resource for managing AWS Cost Optimization Hub Enrollment Status.

-> **TIP:** The Cost Optimization Hub only has a `us-east-1` endpoint. However, you can access the service globally with the AWS Provider from other regions. Other tools, such as the [AWS CLI](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cost-optimization-hub/index.html), may require you to specify the `us-east-1` region when using the service.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.costoptimizationhub_enrollment_status import CostoptimizationhubEnrollmentStatus
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CostoptimizationhubEnrollmentStatus(self, "example")
```

### Usage with all the arguments

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.costoptimizationhub_enrollment_status import CostoptimizationhubEnrollmentStatus
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CostoptimizationhubEnrollmentStatus(self, "example",
            include_member_accounts=True
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are optional:

* `include_member_accounts` - (Optional) Flag to enroll member accounts of the organization if the account is the management account. No drift detection is currently supported for this argument. Default value is `false`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `status` - Status of enrollment. When the resource is present in Terraform, its status will always be `Active`.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Cost Optimization Hub Enrollment Status using your AWS account ID. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.costoptimizationhub_enrollment_status import CostoptimizationhubEnrollmentStatus
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CostoptimizationhubEnrollmentStatus.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "111222333444")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Cost Optimization Hub Enrollment Status using your AWS account ID. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_costoptimizationhub_enrollment_status.example 111222333444
```
