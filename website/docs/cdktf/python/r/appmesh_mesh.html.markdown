# Resource: aws_appmesh_mesh

Provides an AWS App Mesh service mesh resource.

## Example Usage

### Basic

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.appmesh_mesh import AppmeshMesh
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        AppmeshMesh(self, "simple",
            name="simpleapp"
        )
```

### Egress Filter

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.appmesh_mesh import AppmeshMesh
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        AppmeshMesh(self, "simple",
            name="simpleapp",
            spec=AppmeshMeshSpec(
                egress_filter=AppmeshMeshSpecEgressFilter(
                    type="ALLOW_ALL"
                )
            )
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name to use for the service mesh. Must be between 1 and 255 characters in length.
* `spec` - (Optional) Service mesh specification to apply.
* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

The `spec` object supports the following:

* `egress_filter`- (Optional) Egress filter rules for the service mesh.

The `egress_filter` object supports the following:

* `type` - (Optional) Egress filter type. By default, the type is `DROP_ALL`.
Valid values are `ALLOW_ALL` and `DROP_ALL`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - ID of the service mesh.
* `arn` - ARN of the service mesh.
* `created_date` - Creation date of the service mesh.
* `last_updated_date` - Last update date of the service mesh.
* `mesh_owner` - AWS account ID of the service mesh's owner.
* `resource_owner` - Resource owner's AWS account ID.
* `tags_all` - Map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import App Mesh service meshes using the `name`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Using `terraform import`, import App Mesh service meshes using the `name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_appmesh_mesh.simple simpleapp
```
