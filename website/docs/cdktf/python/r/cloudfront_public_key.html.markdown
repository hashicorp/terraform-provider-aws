# Resource: aws_cloudfront_public_key

## Example Usage

The following example below creates a CloudFront public key.

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Fn, Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.cloudfront_public_key import CloudfrontPublicKey
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CloudfrontPublicKey(self, "example",
            comment="test public key",
            encoded_key=Token.as_string(Fn.file("public_key.pem")),
            name="test_key"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `comment` - (Optional) An optional comment about the public key.
* `encoded_key` - (Required) The encoded public key that you want to add to CloudFront to use with features like field-level encryption.
* `name` - (Optional) The name for the public key. By default generated by Terraform.
* `name_prefix` - (Optional) The name for the public key. Conflicts with `name`.

**NOTE:** When setting `encoded_key` value, there needs a newline at the end of string. Otherwise, multiple runs of terraform will want to recreate the `aws_cloudfront_public_key` resource.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `caller_reference` - Internal value used by CloudFront to allow future updates to the public key configuration.
* `etag` - The current version of the public key. For example: `E2QWRUHAPOMQZL`.
* `id` - The identifier for the public key. For example: `K3D5EWEUDCCXON`.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import CloudFront Public Key using the `id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Using `terraform import`, import CloudFront Public Key using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_cloudfront_public_key.example K3D5EWEUDCCXON
```
