# Resource: aws_ram_resource_share_accepter

Manage accepting a Resource Access Manager (RAM) Resource Share invitation. From a _receiver_ AWS account, accept an invitation to share resources that were shared by a _sender_ AWS account. To create a resource share in the _sender_, see the [`aws_ram_resource_share` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/ram_resource_share.html).

~> **Note:** If both AWS accounts are in the same Organization and [RAM Sharing with AWS Organizations is enabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/getting-started-sharing.html#getting-started-sharing-orgs), this resource is not necessary as RAM Resource Share invitations are not used.

## Example Usage

This configuration provides an example of using multiple Terraform AWS providers to configure two different AWS accounts. In the _sender_ account, the configuration creates a `aws_ram_resource_share` and uses a data source in the _receiver_ account to create a `aws_ram_principal_association` resource with the _receiver's_ account ID. In the _receiver_ account, the configuration accepts the invitation to share resources with the `aws_ram_resource_share_accepter`.

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `share_arn` - (Required) The ARN of the resource share.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `invitation_arn` - The ARN of the resource share invitation.
* `share_id` - The ID of the resource share as displayed in the console.
* `status` - The status of the resource share (ACTIVE, PENDING, FAILED, DELETING, DELETED).
* `receiver_account_id` - The account ID of the receiver account which accepts the invitation.
* `sender_account_id` - The account ID of the sender account which submits the invitation.
* `share_name` - The name of the resource share.
* `resources` - A list of the resource ARNs shared via the resource share.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import resource share accepters using the resource share ARN. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Using `terraform import`, import resource share accepters using the resource share ARN. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_ram_resource_share_accepter.example arn:aws:ram:us-east-1:123456789012:resource-share/c4b56393-e8d9-89d9-6dc9-883752de4767
```
