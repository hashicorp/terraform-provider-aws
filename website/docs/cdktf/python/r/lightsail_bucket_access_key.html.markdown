Provides a lightsail bucket access key. This is a set of credentials that allow API requests to be made to the lightsail bucket.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws. import LightsailBucketAccessKeyAccessKey
from imports.aws.lightsail_bucket import LightsailBucket
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        LightsailBucket(self, "test",
            bundle_id="small_1_0",
            name="mytestbucket"
        )
        aws_lightsail_bucket_access_key_access_key_test =
        LightsailBucketAccessKeyAccessKey(self, "test_1",
            bucket_name=aws_lightsail_bucket_access_key_test.id
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_lightsail_bucket_access_key_access_key_test.override_logical_id("test")
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `bucket_name` - (Required) The name of the bucket that the new access key will belong to, and grant access to.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - A combination of attributes separated by a `,` to create a unique id: `bucket_name`,`access_key_id`
* `access_key_id` - The ID of the access key.
* `created_at` - The timestamp when the access key was created.
* `secret_access_key` - The secret access key used to sign requests. This attribute is not available for imported resources. Note that this will be written to the state file.
* `status` - The status of the access key.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_lightsail_bucket_access_key` using the `id` attribute. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.lightsail_bucket_access_key import LightsailBucketAccessKey
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        LightsailBucketAccessKey.generate_config_for_import(self, "test", "example-bucket,AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE")
```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_lightsail_bucket_access_key` using the `id` attribute. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_lightsail_bucket_access_key.test example-bucket,AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
```
