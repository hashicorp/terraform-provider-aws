# Resource: aws_scheduler_schedule

Provides an EventBridge Scheduler Schedule resource.

You can find out more about EventBridge Scheduler in the [User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/scheduler/latest/UserGuide/what-is-scheduler.html).

~> **Note:** EventBridge was formerly known as CloudWatch Events. The functionality is identical.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.scheduler_schedule import SchedulerSchedule
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)

The following arguments are optional:

* `schedule_expression_timezone` - (Optional) Timezone in which the scheduling expression is evaluated. Defaults to `UTC`. Example: `Australia/Sydney`.
* `start_date` - (Optional) The date, in UTC, after which the schedule can begin invoking its target. Depending on the schedule's recurrence expression, invocations might occur on, or after, the start date you specify. EventBridge Scheduler ignores the start date for one-time schedules. Example: `2030-01-01T01:00:00Z`.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import schedules using the combination `group_name/name`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.scheduler_schedule import SchedulerSchedule
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        SchedulerSchedule.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "my-schedule-group/my-schedule")
```

Using `terraform import`, import schedules using the combination `group_name/name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_scheduler_schedule.example my-schedule-group/my-schedule
```
