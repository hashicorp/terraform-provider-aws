from imports.aws.api_gateway_api_key import ApiGatewayApiKey
from imports.aws.api_gateway_rest_api import ApiGatewayRestApi
from imports.aws.api_gateway_usage_plan import ApiGatewayUsagePlan
from imports.aws.api_gateway_usage_plan_key import ApiGatewayUsagePlanKey
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        mykey = ApiGatewayApiKey(self, "mykey",

                stage=foo.stage_name
            )
            ],

* `id` - ID of a usage plan key.
* `key_id` - Identifier of the API gateway key resource.
* `key_type` - Type of a usage plan key. Currently, the valid key type is API_KEY.
* `usage_plan_id` - ID of the API resource
* `name` - Name of a usage plan key.
* `value` - Value of a usage plan key.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import AWS API Gateway Usage Plan Key using the `USAGE-PLAN-ID/USAGE-PLAN-KEY-ID`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.api_gateway_usage_plan_key import ApiGatewayUsagePlanKey
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        ApiGatewayUsagePlanKey.generate_config_for_import(self, "key", "12345abcde/zzz")
```

Using `terraform import`, import AWS API Gateway Usage Plan Key using the `USAGE-PLAN-ID/USAGE-PLAN-KEY-ID`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_api_gateway_usage_plan_key.key 12345abcde/zzz
```
