# Resource: aws_iam_user_group_membership

Provides a resource for adding an [IAM User][2] to [IAM Groups][1]. This
resource can be used multiple times with the same user for non-overlapping
groups.

To exclusively manage the users in a group, see the
[`aws_iam_group_membership` resource][3].

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.iam_group import IamGroup
from imports.aws.iam_user import IamUser
from imports.aws.iam_user_group_membership import IamUserGroupMembership
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        group1 = IamGroup(self, "group1",
            name="group1"
        )
        group2 = IamGroup(self, "group2",
            name="group2"
        )
        group3 = IamGroup(self, "group3",
            name="group3"
        )
        user1 = IamUser(self, "user1",
            name="user1"
        )
        IamUserGroupMembership(self, "example1",
            groups=[group1.name, group2.name],
            user=user1.name
        )
        IamUserGroupMembership(self, "example2",
            groups=[group3.name],
            user=user1.name

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import IAM user group membership using the user name and group names separated by `/`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.iam_user_group_membership import IamUserGroupMembership
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        IamUserGroupMembership.generate_config_for_import(self, "example1", "user1/group1/group2")
```

Using `terraform import`, import IAM user group membership using the user name and group names separated by `/`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_iam_user_group_membership.example1 user1/group1/group2
```
