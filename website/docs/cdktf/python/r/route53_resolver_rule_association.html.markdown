from imports.aws.route53_resolver_rule_association import Route53ResolverRuleAssociation
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        Route53ResolverRuleAssociation.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "rslvr-rrassoc-97242eaf88example")
