## Import

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_route53_resolver_rule_association.example
  identity = {
    id = "rslvr-rrassoc-97242eaf88example"
  }
}

resource "aws_route53_resolver_rule_association" "example" {
  ### Configuration omitted for brevity ###
}
```

### Identity Schema

#### Required

* `id` - (String) ID of the Route53 Resolver rule association.

#### Optional

* `account_id` (String) AWS Account where this resource is managed.
* `region` (String) Region where this resource is managed.

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Route53 Resolver rule associations using the `id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.route53_resolver_rule_association import Route53ResolverRuleAssociation
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        Route53ResolverRuleAssociation.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "rslvr-rrassoc-97242eaf88example")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Route53 Resolver rule associations using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_route53_resolver_rule_association.example rslvr-rrassoc-97242eaf88example
```
