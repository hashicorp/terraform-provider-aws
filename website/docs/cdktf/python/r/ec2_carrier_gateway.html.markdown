# Resource: aws_ec2_carrier_gateway

Manages an EC2 Carrier Gateway. See the AWS [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/Carrier_Gateway.html) for more information.

## Example Usage

```python
# Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.ec2_carrier_gateway import Ec2CarrierGateway
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        Ec2CarrierGateway(self, "example",
            tags={
                "Name": "example-carrier-gateway"
            },
            vpc_id=Token.as_string(aws_vpc_example.id)
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `vpc_id` - (Required) The ID of the VPC to associate with the carrier gateway.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - The ARN of the carrier gateway.
* `id` - The ID of the carrier gateway.
* `owner_id` - The AWS account ID of the owner of the carrier gateway.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

`aws_ec2_carrier_gateway` can be imported using the carrier gateway's ID,
e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_ec2_carrier_gateway.example cgw-12345
```
