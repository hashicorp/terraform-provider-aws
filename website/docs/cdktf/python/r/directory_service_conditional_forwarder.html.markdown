from imports.aws.directory_service_conditional_forwarder import DirectoryServiceConditionalForwarder
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DirectoryServiceConditionalForwarder(self, "example",
            directory_id=ad.id,
            dns_ips=["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"],

* `region` - (Optional) Region where this resource will be [managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints). Defaults to the Region set in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#aws-configuration-reference).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import conditional forwarders using the directory id and remote_domain_name. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.directory_service_conditional_forwarder import DirectoryServiceConditionalForwarder
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DirectoryServiceConditionalForwarder.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "d-1234567890:example.com")
```

Using `terraform import`, import conditional forwarders using the directory id and remote_domain_name. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_directory_service_conditional_forwarder.example d-1234567890:example.com
```
