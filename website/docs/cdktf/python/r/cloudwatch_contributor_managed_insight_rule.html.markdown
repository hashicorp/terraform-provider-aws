from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.cloudwatch_contributor_managed_insight_rule import CloudwatchContributorManagedInsightRule
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CloudwatchContributorManagedInsightRule.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "contributor_managed_insight_rule-id-12345678")
```

Using `terraform import`, import CloudWatch Contributor Managed Insight Rule using the `resource_arn`. For example:
