# Resource: aws_directory_service_trust

Manages a trust relationship between two Active Directory Directories.

The directories may either be both AWS Managed Microsoft AD domains or an AWS Managed Microsoft AD domain and a self-managed Active Directory Domain.

The Trust relationship must be configured on both sides of the relationship.
If a Trust has only been created on one side, it will be in the state `VerifyFailed`.
Once the second Trust is created, the first will update to the correct state.

## Example Usage

### Two-Way Trust

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import the Trust relationship using the directory ID and remote domain name, separated by a `/`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.directory_service_trust import DirectoryServiceTrust
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DirectoryServiceTrust.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "d-926724cf57/directory.example.com")
```

Using `terraform import`, import the Trust relationship using the directory ID and remote domain name, separated by a `/`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_directory_service_trust.example d-926724cf57/directory.example.com
```
