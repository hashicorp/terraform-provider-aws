# Resource: aws_customer_gateway

Provides a customer gateway inside a VPC. These objects can be connected to VPN gateways via VPN connections, and allow you to establish tunnels between your network and the VPC.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.customer_gateway import CustomerGateway
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CustomerGateway(self, "main",
            bgp_asn=Token.as_string(65000),
            ip_address="172.83.124.10",
            tags={
                "Name": "main-customer-gateway"
            },
            type="ipsec.1"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `bgp_asn` - (Optional, Forces new resource) The gateway's Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Number (ASN). Valid values are from  `1` to `2147483647`. Conflicts with `bgp_asn_extended`.
* `bgp_asn_extended` - (Optional, Forces new resource) The gateway's Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Number (ASN). Valid values are from  `2147483648` to `4294967295` Conflicts with `bgp_asn`.
* `certificate_arn` - (Optional) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the customer gateway certificate.
* `device_name` - (Optional) A name for the customer gateway device.
* `ip_address` - (Optional) The IPv4 address for the customer gateway device's outside interface.
* `type` - (Required) The type of customer gateway. The only type AWS
  supports at this time is "ipsec.1".
* `tags` - (Optional) Tags to apply to the gateway. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The amazon-assigned ID of the gateway.
* `arn` - The ARN of the customer gateway.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Customer Gateways using the `id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.customer_gateway import CustomerGateway
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CustomerGateway.generate_config_for_import(self, "main", "cgw-b4dc3961")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Customer Gateways using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_customer_gateway.main cgw-b4dc3961
```
