## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import QuickSight Group membership using the AWS account ID, namespace, group name and member name separated by `/`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.quicksight_group_membership import QuicksightGroupMembership
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        QuicksightGroupMembership.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "123456789123/default/all-access-users/john_smith")
```

Using `terraform import`, import QuickSight Group membership using the AWS account ID, namespace, group name and member name separated by `/`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_quicksight_group_membership.example 123456789123/default/all-access-users/john_smith
```
