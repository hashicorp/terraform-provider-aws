from imports.aws.qbusiness_application import QbusinessApplication
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        QbusinessApplication(self, "example",
            attachments_configuration=[QbusinessApplicationAttachmentsConfiguration(
                attachments_control_mode="ENABLED"
            )
            ],
            display_name="example-app",
            iam_service_role_arn=Token.as_string(aws_iam_role_example.arn),
            identity_center_instance_arn=Token.as_string(
                Fn.lookup_nested(Fn.tolist(data_aws_ssoadmin_instances_example.arns), ["0"]))
        )
```

* `delete` - (Default `30m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import a Q Business Application using the `id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.qbusiness_application import QbusinessApplication
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        QbusinessApplication.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "id-12345678")
```

Using `terraform import`, import a Q Business Application using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_qbusiness_application.example id-12345678
```
