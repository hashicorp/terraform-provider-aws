from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.fms_resource_set import FmsResourceSet
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        FmsResourceSet(self, "example",
            resource_set=[FmsResourceSetResourceSet(
                name="testing",
                resource_type_list=["AWS::NetworkFirewall::Firewall"]

* `create` - (Default `30m`)
* `update` - (Default `30m`)
* `delete` - (Default `30m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import FMS (Firewall Manager) Resource Set using the `id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.fms_resource_set import FmsResourceSet
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        FmsResourceSet.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "resource_set-id-12345678")
```

Using `terraform import`, import FMS (Firewall Manager) Resource Set using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_fms_resource_set.example resource_set-id-12345678
```
