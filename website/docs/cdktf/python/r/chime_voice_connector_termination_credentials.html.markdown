# Resource: aws_chime_voice_connector_termination_credentials

Adds termination SIP credentials for the specified Amazon Chime Voice Connector.

~> **Note:** Voice Connector Termination Credentials requires a [Voice Connector Termination](/docs/providers/aws/r/chime_voice_connector_termination.html) to be present. Use of `depends_on` (as shown below) is recommended to avoid race conditions.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.

from imports.aws.chime_voice_connector import ChimeVoiceConnector
from imports.aws.chime_voice_connector_termination import ChimeVoiceConnectorTermination
from imports.aws.chime_voice_connector_termination_credentials import ChimeVoiceConnectorTerminationCredentials
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        default_var = ChimeVoiceConnector(self, "default",
            name="test",
            require_encryption=True
        )
        aws_chime_voice_connector_termination_default =
        ChimeVoiceConnectorTermination(self, "default_1",
            calling_regions=["US", "CA"],
            cidr_allow_list=["50.35.78.96/31"],
            cps_limit=1,
            disabled=True,
            voice_connector_id=default_var.id
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_chime_voice_connector_termination_default.override_logical_id("default")
        aws_chime_voice_connector_termination_credentials_default =
        ChimeVoiceConnectorTerminationCredentials(self, "default_2",
            credentials=[ChimeVoiceConnectorTerminationCredentialsCredentials(
                password="test!",
                username="test"
            )
            ],
            depends_on=[aws_chime_voice_connector_termination_default],
            voice_connector_id=default_var.id
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `voice_connector_id` - (Required) Amazon Chime Voice Connector ID.
* `credentials` - (Required) List of termination SIP credentials.

### `credentials`

The SIP credentials used to authenticate requests to your Amazon Chime Voice Connector.

* `username` - (Required) RFC2617 compliant username associated with the SIP credentials.
* `password` - (Required) RFC2617 compliant password associated with the SIP credentials.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - Amazon Chime Voice Connector ID.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Chime Voice Connector Termination Credentials using the `voice_connector_id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Using `terraform import`, import Chime Voice Connector Termination Credentials using the `voice_connector_id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_chime_voice_connector_termination_credentials.default abcdef1ghij2klmno3pqr4
```
