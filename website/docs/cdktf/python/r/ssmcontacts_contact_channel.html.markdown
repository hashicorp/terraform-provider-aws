class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)

            name="Example contact channel",
            type="EMAIL"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

~> **NOTE:** The contact channel needs to be activated in the AWS Systems Manager console, otherwise it can't be used to engage the contact. See the [Contacts section of the Incident Manager User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/incident-manager/latest/userguide/contacts.html) for more information.

The following arguments are required:

- `contact_id` - (Required) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS SSM Contact that the contact channel belongs to.

- `delivery_address` - (Required) Block that contains contact engagement details. See details below.

- `name` - (Required) Name of the contact channel. Must be between 1 and 255 characters, and may contain alphanumerics, underscores (`_`), hyphens (`-`), periods (`.`), and spaces.

- `type` - (Required) Type of the contact channel. One of `SMS`, `VOICE` or `EMAIL`.

### delivery_address

- `simple_address` - (Required) Details to engage this contact channel. The expected format depends on the contact channel type and is described in the [`ContactChannelAddress` section of the SSM Contacts API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/incident-manager/latest/APIReference/API_SSMContacts_ContactChannelAddress.html).

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

- `activation_status` - Whether the contact channel is activated. The contact channel must be activated to use it to engage the contact. One of `ACTIVATED` or `NOT_ACTIVATED`.

- `arn` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the contact channel.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import SSM Contact Channel using the `ARN`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Using `terraform import`, import SSM Contact Channel using the `ARN`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_ssmcontacts_contact_channel.example arn:aws:ssm-contacts:us-west-2:123456789012:contact-channel/example
```
