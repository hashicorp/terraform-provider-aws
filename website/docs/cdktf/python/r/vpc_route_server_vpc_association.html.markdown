## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to  to import VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) Route Server Association using the associated resource ID and VPC Id separated by a comma (,). For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws. import VpcRouteServerVpcAssociation
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        VpcRouteServerVpcAssociation.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "rs-12345678,vpc-0f001273ec18911b1")
```

Using `terraform import`, to  to import VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) Route Server Association using the associated resource ID and VPC Id separated by a comma (,). For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_vpc_route_server_vpc_association.example rs-12345678,vpc-0f001273ec18911b1
```
