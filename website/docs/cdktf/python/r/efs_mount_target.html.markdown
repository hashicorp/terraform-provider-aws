# Resource: aws_efs_mount_target

Provides an Elastic File System (EFS) mount target.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.efs_mount_target import EfsMountTarget
from imports.aws.subnet import Subnet
from imports.aws.vpc import Vpc
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        foo = Vpc(self, "foo",
            cidr_block="10.0.0.0/16"
        )
        alpha = Subnet(self, "alpha",
            availability_zone="us-west-2a",
            cidr_block="10.0.1.0/24",
            vpc_id=foo.id
        )
        aws_efs_mount_target_alpha = EfsMountTarget(self, "alpha_2",
            file_system_id=Token.as_string(aws_efs_file_system_foo.id),
            subnet_id=alpha.id
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_efs_mount_target_alpha.override_logical_id("alpha")
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `file_system_id` - (Required) The ID of the file system for which the mount target is intended.
* `subnet_id` - (Required) The ID of the subnet to add the mount target in.
* `ip_address` - (Optional) The address (within the address range of the specified subnet) at
which the file system may be mounted via the mount target.
* `security_groups` - (Optional) A list of up to 5 VPC security group IDs (that must
be for the same VPC as subnet specified) in effect for the mount target.

## Attribute Reference

~> **Note:** The `dns_name` and `mount_target_dns_name` attributes are only useful if the mount target is in a VPC that has
support for DNS hostnames enabled. See [Using DNS with Your VPC](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-dns.html)
and [VPC resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/vpc.html#enable_dns_hostnames) in Terraform for more information.

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The ID of the mount target.
* `dns_name` - The DNS name for the EFS file system.
* `mount_target_dns_name` - The DNS name for the given subnet/AZ per [documented convention](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/mounting-fs-mount-cmd-dns-name.html).
* `file_system_arn` - Amazon Resource Name of the file system.
* `network_interface_id` - The ID of the network interface that Amazon EFS created when it created the mount target.
* `availability_zone_name` - The name of the Availability Zone (AZ) that the mount target resides in.
* `availability_zone_id` - The unique and consistent identifier of the Availability Zone (AZ) that the mount target resides in.
* `owner_id` - AWS account ID that owns the resource.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

- `create` - (Default `30m`)
- `delete` - (Default `10m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import the EFS mount targets using the `id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.efs_mount_target import EfsMountTarget
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        EfsMountTarget.generate_config_for_import(self, "alpha", "fsmt-52a643fb")
```

Using `terraform import`, import the EFS mount targets using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_efs_mount_target.alpha fsmt-52a643fb
```
