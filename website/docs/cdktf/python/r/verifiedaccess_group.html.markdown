#
from imports.aws.verifiedaccess_group import VerifiedaccessGroup
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        VerifiedaccessGroup(self, "example",
            verifiedaccess_instance_id=Token.as_string(aws_verifiedaccess_instance_example.id)
        )
```
