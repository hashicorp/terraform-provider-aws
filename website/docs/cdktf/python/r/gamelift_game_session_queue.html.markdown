# Resource: aws_gamelift_game_session_queue

Provides an GameLift Game Session Queue resource.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.gamelift_game_session_queue import GameliftGameSessionQueue
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        GameliftGameSessionQueue(self, "test",
            destinations=[us_west2_fleet.arn, eu_central1_fleet.arn],
            name="example-session-queue",
            notification_target=game_session_queue_notifications.arn,
            player_latency_policy=[GameliftGameSessionQueuePlayerLatencyPolicy(
                maximum_individual_player_latency_milliseconds=100,
                policy_duration_seconds=5
            ), GameliftGameSessionQueuePlayerLatencyPolicy(
                maximum_individual_player_latency_milliseconds=200
            )
            ],
            timeout_in_seconds=60
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the session queue.
* `timeout_in_seconds` - (Required) Maximum time a game session request can remain in the queue.
* `custom_event_data` - (Optional) Information to be added to all events that are related to this game session queue.
* `destinations` - (Optional) List of fleet/alias ARNs used by session queue for placing game sessions.
* `notification_target` - (Optional) An SNS topic ARN that is set up to receive game session placement notifications.
* `player_latency_policy` - (Optional) One or more policies used to choose fleet based on player latency. See below.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

### Nested Fields

#### `player_latency_policy`

* `maximum_individual_player_latency_milliseconds` - (Required) Maximum latency value that is allowed for any player.
* `policy_duration_seconds` - (Optional) Length of time that the policy is enforced while placing a new game session. Absence of value for this attribute means that the policy is enforced until the queue times out.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - Game Session Queue ARN.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import GameLift Game Session Queues using their `name`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.gamelift_game_session_queue import GameliftGameSessionQueue
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        GameliftGameSessionQueue.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "example")
```

Using `terraform import`, import GameLift Game Session Queues using their `name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_gamelift_game_session_queue.example example
```
