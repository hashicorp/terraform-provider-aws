Provides a resource to manage an AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authorities Permission.
Currently, this is only required in order to allow the ACM service to automatically renew certificates issued by a PCA.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.

from imports.aws.acmpca_certificate_authority import AcmpcaCertificateAuthority
from imports.aws.acmpca_permission import AcmpcaPermission
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = AcmpcaCertificateAuthority(self, "example",
            certificate_authority_configuration=AcmpcaCertificateAuthorityCertificateAuthorityConfiguration(
                key_algorithm="RSA_4096",
                signing_algorithm="SHA512WITHRSA",
                subject=AcmpcaCertificateAuthorityCertificateAuthorityConfigurationSubject(
                    common_name="example.com"
                )
            )
        )
        aws_acmpca_permission_example = AcmpcaPermission(self, "example_1",
            actions=["IssueCertificate", "GetCertificate", "ListPermissions"],
            certificate_authority_arn=example.arn,
            principal="acm.amazonaws.com"
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_acmpca_permission_example.override_logical_id("example")
```
