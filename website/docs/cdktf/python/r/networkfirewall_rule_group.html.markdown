# Resource: aws_networkfirewall_rule_group

Provides an AWS Network Firewall Rule Group Resource

## Example Usage

### Stateful Inspection for denying access to a domain

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.

    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)

        #     not inside of the Terraform context. If you are looping over something external, e.g. a variable or a file input
        #     you should consider using a for loop. If you are looping over something only known to Terraform, e.g. a result of a data source
        #     you need to keep this like it is.

            type="STATEFUL"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `capacity` - (Required, Forces new resource) The maximum number of operating resources that this rule group can use. For a stateless rule group, the capacity required is the sum of the capacity requirements of the individual rules. For a stateful rule group, the minimum capacity required is the number of individual rules.

* `description` - (Optional) A friendly description of the rule group.

* `encryption_configuration` - (Optional) KMS encryption configuration settings. See [Encryption Configuration](#encryption-configuration) below for details.

* `name` - (Required, Forces new resource) A friendly name of the rule group.

* `rule_group` - (Optional) A configuration block that defines the rule group rules. Required unless `rules` is specified. See [Rule Group](#rule-group) below for details.

* `rules` - (Optional) The stateful rule group rules specifications in Suricata file format, with one rule per line. Use this to import your existing Suricata compatible rule groups. Required unless `rule_group` is specified.

* `tags` - (Optional) A map of key:value pairs to associate with the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

* `type` - (Required) Whether the rule group is stateless (containing stateless rules) or stateful (containing stateful rules). Valid values include: `STATEFUL` or `STATELESS`.

### Encryption Configuration

`encryption_configuration` settings for customer managed KMS keys. Remove this block to use the default AWS-managed KMS encryption (rather than setting `type` to `AWS_OWNED_KMS_KEY`).

* `key_id` - (Optional) The ID of the customer managed key. You can use any of the [key identifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-id) that KMS supports, unless you're using a key that's managed by another account.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Network Firewall Rule Groups using their `arn`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.networkfirewall_rule_group import NetworkfirewallRuleGroup
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        NetworkfirewallRuleGroup.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "arn:aws:network-firewall:us-west-1:123456789012:stateful-rulegroup/example")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Network Firewall Rule Groups using their `arn`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_networkfirewall_rule_group.example arn:aws:network-firewall:us-west-1:123456789012:stateful-rulegroup/example
```
