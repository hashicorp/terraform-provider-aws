# Resource: aws_iot_thing_group_membership

Adds an IoT Thing to an IoT Thing Group.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.iot_thing_group_membership import IotThingGroupMembership
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        IotThingGroupMembership(self, "example",
            override_dynamic_group=True,
            thing_group_name="example-group",
            thing_name="example-thing"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

* `thing_name` - (Required) The name of the thing to add to a group.
* `thing_group_name` - (Required) The name of the group to which you are adding a thing.
* `override_dynamic_group` - (Optional) Override dynamic thing groups with static thing groups when 10-group limit is reached. If a thing belongs to 10 thing groups, and one or more of those groups are dynamic thing groups, adding a thing to a static group removes the thing from the last dynamic group.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The membership ID.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import IoT Thing Group Membership using the thing group name and thing name. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.iot_thing_group_membership import IotThingGroupMembership
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        IotThingGroupMembership.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "thing_group_name/thing_name")
```

Using `terraform import`, import IoT Thing Group Membership using the thing group name and thing name. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_iot_thing_group_membership.example thing_group_name/thing_name
```
