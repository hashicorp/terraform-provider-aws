# Resource: aws_lightsail_static_ip_attachment

Manages a static IP address attachment - relationship between a Lightsail static IP and Lightsail instance.

Use this resource to attach a static IP address to a Lightsail instance to provide a consistent public IP address that persists across instance restarts.

~> **Note:** Lightsail is currently only supported in a limited number of AWS Regions, please see ["Regions and Availability Zones in Amazon Lightsail"](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/overview/article/understanding-regions-and-availability-zones-in-amazon-lightsail) for more details.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.lightsail_instance import LightsailInstance
from imports.aws.lightsail_static_ip import LightsailStaticIp
from imports.aws.lightsail_static_ip_attachment import LightsailStaticIpAttachment
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = LightsailInstance(self, "example",
            availability_zone="us-east-1a",
            blueprint_id="ubuntu_20_04",
            bundle_id="nano_2_0",
            name="example"
        )
        aws_lightsail_static_ip_example = LightsailStaticIp(self, "example_1",
            name="example"
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_lightsail_static_ip_example.override_logical_id("example")
        aws_lightsail_static_ip_attachment_example =
        LightsailStaticIpAttachment(self, "example_2",
            instance_name=example.id,
            static_ip_name=Token.as_string(aws_lightsail_static_ip_example.id)
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_lightsail_static_ip_attachment_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `instance_name` - (Required) Name of the Lightsail instance to attach the IP to.
* `static_ip_name` - (Required) Name of the allocated static IP.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `ip_address` - Allocated static IP address.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_lightsail_static_ip_attachment` using the static IP name. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.lightsail_static_ip_attachment import LightsailStaticIpAttachment
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        LightsailStaticIpAttachment.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "example-static-ip")
```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_lightsail_static_ip_attachment` using the static IP name. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_lightsail_static_ip_attachment.example example-static-ip
```
