# Resource: aws_detective_organization_configuration

Manages the Detective Organization Configuration in the current AWS Region. The AWS account utilizing this resource must have been assigned as a delegated Organization administrator account, e.g., via the [`aws_detective_organization_admin_account` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/detective_organization_admin_account.html). More information about Organizations support in Detective can be found in the [Detective User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/adminguide/accounts-orgs-transition.html).

~> **NOTE:** This is an advanced Terraform resource. Terraform will automatically assume management of the Detective Organization Configuration without import and perform no actions on removal from the Terraform configuration.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.detective_graph import DetectiveGraph
from imports.aws.detective_organization_configuration import DetectiveOrganizationConfiguration
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = DetectiveGraph(self, "example",
            enable=True
        )
        aws_detective_organization_configuration_example =
        DetectiveOrganizationConfiguration(self, "example_1",
            auto_enable=True,
            graph_arn=example.graph_arn
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_detective_organization_configuration_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `auto_enable` - (Required) When this setting is enabled, all new accounts that are created in, or added to, the organization are added as a member accounts of the organizationâ€™s Detective delegated administrator and Detective is enabled in that AWS Region.
* `graph_arn` - (Required) ARN of the behavior graph.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - Identifier of the Detective Graph.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_detective_organization_admin_account` using the behavior graph ARN. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.detective_organization_configuration import DetectiveOrganizationConfiguration
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DetectiveOrganizationConfiguration.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "arn:aws:detective:us-east-1:123456789012:graph:00b00fd5aecc0ab60a708659477e9617")
```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_detective_organization_admin_account` using the behavior graph ARN. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_detective_organization_configuration.example arn:aws:detective:us-east-1:123456789012:graph:00b00fd5aecc0ab60a708659477e9617
```
