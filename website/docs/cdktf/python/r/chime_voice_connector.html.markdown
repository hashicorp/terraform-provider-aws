# Resource: aws_chime_voice_connector

Enables you to connect your phone system to the telephone network at a substantial cost savings by using SIP trunking.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.chime_voice_connector import ChimeVoiceConnector
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        ChimeVoiceConnector(self, "test",
            aws_region="us-east-1",
            name="connector-test-1",
            require_encryption=True
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the Amazon Chime Voice Connector.
* `require_encryption` - (Required) When enabled, requires encryption for the Amazon Chime Voice Connector.

The following arguments are optional:

* `aws_region` - (Optional) The AWS Region in which the Amazon Chime Voice Connector is created. Default value: `us-east-1`
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value mapping of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the Amazon Chime Voice Connector.
* `outbound_host_name` - The outbound host name for the Amazon Chime Voice Connector.
* `tags_all` - Map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Configuration Recorder using the name. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.chime_voice_connector import ChimeVoiceConnector
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        ChimeVoiceConnector.generate_config_for_import(self, "test", "example")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Configuration Recorder using the name. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_chime_voice_connector.test example
```
