# Resource: aws_s3control_access_grants_location

Provides a resource to manage an S3 Access Grants location.
A location is an S3 resource (bucket or prefix) in a permission grant that the grantee can access.
The S3 data must be in the same Region as your S3 Access Grants instance.
When you register a location, you must include the IAM role that has permission to manage the S3 location that you are registering.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.s3_control_access_grants_instance import S3ControlAccessGrantsInstance
from imports.aws.s3_control_access_grants_location import S3ControlAccessGrantsLocation
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = S3ControlAccessGrantsInstance(self, "example")
        aws_s3_control_access_grants_location_example =
        S3ControlAccessGrantsLocation(self, "example_1",
            depends_on=[example],
            iam_role_arn=Token.as_string(aws_iam_role_example.arn),
            location_scope="s3://"
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_s3_control_access_grants_location_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `account_id` - (Optional) The AWS account ID for the S3 Access Grants location. Defaults to automatically determined account ID of the Terraform AWS provider.
* `iam_role_arn` - (Required) The ARN of the IAM role that S3 Access Grants should use when fulfilling runtime access
requests to the location.
* `location_scope` - (Required) The default S3 URI `s3://` or the URI to a custom location, a specific bucket or prefix.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `access_grants_location_arn` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the S3 Access Grants location.
* `access_grants_location_id` - Unique ID of the S3 Access Grants location.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import S3 Access Grants locations using the `account_id` and `access_grants_location_id`, separated by a comma (`,`). For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.s3_control_access_grants_location import S3ControlAccessGrantsLocation
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        S3ControlAccessGrantsLocation.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "123456789012,default")
```

Using `terraform import`, import S3 Access Grants locations using the `account_id` and `access_grants_location_id`, separated by a comma (`,`). For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_s3control_access_grants_location.example 123456789012,default
```
