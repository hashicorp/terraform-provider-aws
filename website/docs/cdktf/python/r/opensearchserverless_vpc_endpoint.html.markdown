#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.opensearchserverless_vpc_endpoint import OpensearchserverlessVpcEndpoint
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        OpensearchserverlessVpcEndpoint(self, "example",
            name="myendpoint",
            subnet_ids=[Token.as_string(aws_subnet_example.id)],
            vpc_id=Token.as_string(aws_vpc_example.id)
        )
```

## Argument Reference

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `create` - (Default `30m`)
* `update` - (Default `30m`)
* `delete` - (Default `30m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import OpenSearchServerless Vpc Endpointa using the `id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.opensearchserverless_vpc_endpoint import OpensearchserverlessVpcEndpoint
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        OpensearchserverlessVpcEndpoint.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "vpce-8012925589")
```

Using `terraform import`, import OpenSearchServerless Vpc Endpointa using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_opensearchserverless_vpc_endpoint.example vpce-8012925589
```
