class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        current = DataAwsCallerIdentity(self, "current")
        OpensearchAuthorizeVpcEndpointAccess(self, "test",
            account=Token.as_string(current.account_id),
            domain_name=Token.as_string(aws_opensearch_domain_test.domain_name)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import OpenSearch Authorize Vpc Endpoint Access using the `example_id_arg`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.opensearch_authorize_vpc_endpoint_access import OpensearchAuthorizeVpcEndpointAccess
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        OpensearchAuthorizeVpcEndpointAccess.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "authorize_vpc_endpoint_access-id-12345678")
```

Using `terraform import`, import OpenSearch Authorize Vpc Endpoint Access using the `example_id_arg`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_opensearch_authorize_vpc_endpoint_access.example authorize_vpc_endpoint_access-id-12345678
```
