## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `deployment_type` - (Required) The filesystem deployment type. Valid values: `SINGLE_AZ_1`, `SINGLE_AZ_2` and `MULTI_AZ_1`.
* `storage_capacity` - (Required) The storage capacity (GiB) of the file system. Valid values between `64` and `524288`.
* `subnet_ids` - (Required) A list of IDs for the subnets that the file system will be accessible from.
* `throughput_capacity` - (Required) Throughput (MB/s) of the file system. Valid values depend on `deployment_type`. Must be one of `64`, `128`, `256`, `512`, `1024`, `2048`, `3072`, `4096` for `SINGLE_AZ_1`. Must be one of `160`, `320`, `640`, `1280`, `2560`, `3840`, `5120`, `7680`, `10240` for `SINGLE_AZ_2`.

The following arguments are optional:

* `automatic_backup_retention_days` - (Optional) The number of days to retain automatic backups. Setting this to 0 disables automatic backups. You can retain automatic backups for a maximum of 90 days.
* `backup_id` - (Optional) The ID of the source backup to create the filesystem from.
* `copy_tags_to_backups` - (Optional) A boolean flag indicating whether tags for the file system should be copied to backups. The default value is false.
* `copy_tags_to_volumes` - (Optional) A boolean flag indicating whether tags for the file system should be copied to snapshots. The default value is false.
* `daily_automatic_backup_start_time` - (Optional) A recurring daily time, in the format HH:MM. HH is the zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and MM is the zero-padded minute of the hour. For example, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily. Requires `automatic_backup_retention_days` to be set.
* `delete_options` - (Optional) List of delete options, which at present supports only one value that specifies whether to delete all child volumes and snapshots when the file system is deleted. Valid values: `DELETE_CHILD_VOLUMES_AND_SNAPSHOTS`.
* `disk_iops_configuration` - (Optional) The SSD IOPS configuration for the Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system. See [`disk_iops_configuration` Block](#disk_iops_configuration-block) for details.
* `endpoint_ip_address_range` - (Optional) (Multi-AZ only) Specifies the IP address range in which the endpoints to access your file system will be created.
* `final_backup_tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to apply to the file system's final backup.
* `kms_key_id` - (Optional) ARN for the KMS Key to encrypt the file system at rest, Defaults to an AWS managed KMS Key.
* `preferred_subnet_id` - (Optional) (Multi-AZ only) Required when `deployment_type` is set to `MULTI_AZ_1`. This specifies the subnet in which you want the preferred file server to be located.
* `root_volume_configuration` - (Optional) The configuration for the root volume of the file system. All other volumes are children or the root volume. See [`root_volume_configuration` Block](#root_volume_configuration-block) for details.
* `route_table_ids` - (Optional) (Multi-AZ only) Specifies the route tables in which Amazon FSx creates the rules for routing traffic to the correct file server. You should specify all virtual private cloud (VPC) route tables associated with the subnets in which your clients are located. By default, Amazon FSx selects your VPC's default route table.
* `security_group_ids` - (Optional) A list of IDs for the security groups that apply to the specified network interfaces created for file system access. These security groups will apply to all network interfaces.
* `skip_final_backup` - (Optional) When enabled, will skip the default final backup taken when the file system is deleted. This configuration must be applied separately before attempting to delete the resource to have the desired behavior. Defaults to `false`.
* `storage_type` - (Optional) The filesystem storage type. Only `SSD` is supported.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the file system. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `weekly_maintenance_start_time` - (Optional) The preferred start time (in `d:HH:MM` format) to perform weekly maintenance, in the UTC time zone.

### `disk_iops_configuration` Block

The `disk_iops_configuration` configuration block supports the following arguments:

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import FSx File Systems using the `id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.fsx_openzfs_file_system import FsxOpenzfsFileSystem
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        FsxOpenzfsFileSystem.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "fs-543ab12b1ca672f33")
```

Using `terraform import`, import FSx File Systems using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_fsx_openzfs_file_system.example fs-543ab12b1ca672f33
```

Certain resource arguments, like `security_group_ids`, do not have a FSx API method for reading the information after creation. If the argument is set in the Terraform configuration on an imported resource, Terraform will always show a difference. To workaround this behavior, either omit the argument from the Terraform configuration or use [`ignore_changes`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/meta-arguments/lifecycle.html#ignore_changes) to hide the difference. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from cdktf import TerraformResourceLifecycle
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.fsx_openzfs_file_system import FsxOpenzfsFileSystem
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name, *, deploymentType, subnetIds, throughputCapacity):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        FsxOpenzfsFileSystem(self, "example",
            lifecycle=TerraformResourceLifecycle(
                ignore_changes=[security_group_ids]
            ),
            security_group_ids=[Token.as_string(aws_security_group_example.id)],
            deployment_type=deployment_type,
            subnet_ids=subnet_ids,
            throughput_capacity=throughput_capacity
        )
```
