## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the SSL negotiation policy.
* `load_balancer` - (Required) The load balancer to which the policy
  should be attached.
* `lb_port` - (Required) The load balancer port to which the policy
  should be applied. This must be an active listener on the load
balancer.
* `attribute` - (Optional) An SSL Negotiation policy attribute. Each has two properties:
    * `name` - The name of the attribute
    * `value` - The value of the attribute
* `triggers` - (Optional) Map of arbitrary keys and values that, when changed, will trigger a redeployment. To force a redeployment without changing these keys/values, use the [`terraform taint` command](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/taint.html).

To set your attributes, please see the [AWS Elastic Load Balancing Developer Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/elb-security-policy-table.html) for a listing of the supported SSL protocols, SSL options, and SSL ciphers.

~> **NOTE:** The AWS documentation references Server Order Preference, which the AWS Elastic Load Balancing API refers to as `Server-Defined-Cipher-Order`. If you wish to set Server Order Preference, use this value instead.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The ID of the policy.
* `name` - The name of the stickiness policy.
* `load_balancer` - The load balancer to which the policy is attached.
* `lb_port` - The load balancer port to which the policy is applied.
* `attribute` - The SSL Negotiation policy attributes.
