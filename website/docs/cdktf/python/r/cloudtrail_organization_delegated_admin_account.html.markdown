```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.cloudtrail_organization_delegated_admin_account import CloudtrailOrganizationDelegatedAdminAccount
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CloudtrailOrganizationDelegatedAdminAccount.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "12345678901")
```

Using `terraform import`, import delegated administrators using the delegate account `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_cloudtrail_organization_delegated_admin_account.example 12345678901
```
