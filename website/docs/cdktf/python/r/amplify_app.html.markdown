# Resource: aws_amplify_app

Provides an Amplify App resource, a fullstack serverless app hosted on the [AWS Amplify Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/welcome.html).

~> **Note:** When you create/update an Amplify App from Terraform, you may end up with the error "BadRequestException: You should at least provide one valid token" because of authentication issues. See the section "Repository with Tokens" below.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.amplify_app import AmplifyApp
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        AmplifyApp(self, "example",
            build_spec="version: 0.1\nfrontend:\n  phases:\n    preBuild:\n      commands:\n        - yarn install\n    build:\n      commands:\n        - yarn run build\n  artifacts:\n    baseDirectory: build\n    files:\n      - '**/*'\n  cache:\n    paths:\n      - node_modules/**/*\n\n",
            custom_rule=[AmplifyAppCustomRule(
                source="/<*>",
                status="404",
                target="/index.html"
            )
            ],
            environment_variables={
                "ENV": "test"
            },
            name="example",
            repository="https://github.com/example/app"
        )
```

### Repository with Tokens

If you create a new Amplify App with the `repository` argument, you also need to set `oauth_token` or `access_token` for authentication. For GitHub, get a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) and set `access_token` as follows:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.amplify_app import AmplifyApp
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        AmplifyApp(self, "example",
            access_token="...",
            name="example",
            repository="https://github.com/example/app"
        )
```

You can omit `access_token` if you import an existing Amplify App created by the Amplify Console (using OAuth for authentication).

### Auto Branch Creation

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.amplify_app import AmplifyApp
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        AmplifyApp(self, "example",
            auto_branch_creation_config=AmplifyAppAutoBranchCreationConfig(
                enable_auto_build=True
            ),
            auto_branch_creation_patterns=["*", "*/**"],
            enable_auto_branch_creation=True,
            name="example"
        )
```

### Basic Authorization

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Fn, Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.amplify_app import AmplifyApp
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        AmplifyApp(self, "example",
            basic_auth_credentials=Token.as_string(
                Fn.base64encode("username1:password1")),
            enable_basic_auth=True,
            name="example"
        )
```

  name = "example"

  # Reverse Proxy Rewrite for API requests

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name for an Amplify app.
* `access_token` - (Optional) Personal access token for a third-party source control system for an Amplify app. This token must have write access to the relevant repo to create a webhook and a read-only deploy key for the Amplify project. The token is not stored, so after applying this attribute can be removed and the setup token deleted.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Amplify App using Amplify App ID (appId). For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.amplify_app import AmplifyApp
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        AmplifyApp.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "d2ypk4k47z8u6")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Amplify App using Amplify App ID (appId). For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_amplify_app.example d2ypk4k47z8u6
```

App ID can be obtained from App ARN (e.g., `arn:aws:amplify:us-east-1:12345678:apps/d2ypk4k47z8u6`).
