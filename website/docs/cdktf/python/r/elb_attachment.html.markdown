# Resource: aws_elb_attachment

Attaches an EC2 instance to an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). For attaching resources with Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB), see the [`aws_lb_target_group_attachment` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/lb_target_group_attachment.html).

~> **NOTE on ELB Instances and ELB Attachments:** Terraform currently provides
both a standalone ELB Attachment resource (describing an instance attached to
an ELB), and an [Elastic Load Balancer resource](elb.html) with
`instances` defined in-line. At this time you cannot use an ELB with in-line
instances in conjunction with an ELB Attachment resource. Doing so will cause a
conflict and will overwrite attachments.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.elb_attachment import ElbAttachment
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        ElbAttachment(self, "baz",
            elb=bar.id,
            instance=foo.id
        )
```
