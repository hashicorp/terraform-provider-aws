# Resource: aws_securityhub_standards_control

Disable/enable Security Hub standards control in the current region.

The `aws_securityhub_standards_control` behaves differently from normal resources, in that
Terraform does not _create_ this resource, but instead "adopts" it
into management. When you _delete_ this resource configuration, Terraform "abandons" resource as is and just removes it from the state.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.securityhub_account import SecurityhubAccount
from imports.aws.securityhub_standards_control import SecurityhubStandardsControl
from imports.aws.securityhub_standards_subscription import SecurityhubStandardsSubscription
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = SecurityhubAccount(self, "example")
        cis_aws_foundations_benchmark = SecurityhubStandardsSubscription(self, "cis_aws_foundations_benchmark",
            depends_on=[example],
            standards_arn="arn:aws:securityhub:::ruleset/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark/v/1.2.0"
        )
        SecurityhubStandardsControl(self, "ensure_iam_password_policy_prevents_password_reuse",
            control_status="DISABLED",
            depends_on=[cis_aws_foundations_benchmark],
            disabled_reason="We handle password policies within Okta",
            standards_control_arn="arn:aws:securityhub:us-east-1:111111111111:control/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark/v/1.2.0/1.10"
        )
```
