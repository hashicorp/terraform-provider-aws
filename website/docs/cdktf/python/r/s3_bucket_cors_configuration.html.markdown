# Resource: aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration

Provides an S3 bucket CORS configuration resource. For more information about CORS, go to [Enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/cors.html) in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

~> **NOTE:** S3 Buckets only support a single CORS configuration. Declaring multiple `aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration` resources to the same S3 Bucket will cause a perpetual difference in configuration.

-> This resource cannot be used with S3 directory buckets.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.s3_bucket import S3Bucket
from imports.aws.s3_bucket_cors_configuration import S3BucketCorsConfiguration
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = S3Bucket(self, "example",
            bucket="mybucket"
        )
        aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration_example = S3BucketCorsConfiguration(self, "example_1",
            bucket=example.id,
            cors_rule=[S3BucketCorsConfigurationCorsRule(
                allowed_headers=["*"],
                allowed_methods=["PUT", "POST"],
                allowed_origins=["https://s3-website-test.hashicorp.com"],
                expose_headers=["ETag"],
                max_age_seconds=3000
            ), S3BucketCorsConfigurationCorsRule(
                allowed_methods=["GET"],
                allowed_origins=["*"]
            )
            ]
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `bucket` - (Required, Forces new resource) Name of the bucket.
* `expected_bucket_owner` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Account ID of the expected bucket owner.
* `cors_rule` - (Required) Set of origins and methods (cross-origin access that you want to allow). [See below](#cors_rule). You can configure up to 100 rules.

### cors_rule

The `cors_rule` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `allowed_headers` - (Optional) Set of Headers that are specified in the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` header.
* `allowed_methods` - (Required) Set of HTTP methods that you allow the origin to execute. Valid values are `GET`, `PUT`, `HEAD`, `POST`, and `DELETE`.
* `allowed_origins` - (Required) Set of origins you want customers to be able to access the bucket from.
* `expose_headers` - (Optional) Set of headers in the response that you want customers to be able to access from their applications (for example, from a JavaScript `XMLHttpRequest` object).
* `id` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the rule. The value cannot be longer than 255 characters.
* `max_age_seconds` - (Optional) Time in seconds that your browser is to cache the preflight response for the specified resource.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The `bucket` or `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`) if the latter is provided.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import S3 bucket CORS configuration using the `bucket` or using the `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`). For example:

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket is the same account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket`:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.s3_bucket_cors_configuration import S3BucketCorsConfiguration
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        S3BucketCorsConfiguration.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "bucket-name")
```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket differs from the account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`):

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.s3_bucket_cors_configuration import S3BucketCorsConfiguration
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        S3BucketCorsConfiguration.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "bucket-name,123456789012")
```

**Using `terraform import` to import** S3 bucket CORS configuration using the `bucket` or using the `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`). For example:

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket is the same account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket`:

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration.example bucket-name
```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket differs from the account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`):

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration.example bucket-name,123456789012
```
