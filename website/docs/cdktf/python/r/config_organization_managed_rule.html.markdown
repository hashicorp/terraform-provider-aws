# Resource: aws_config_organization_managed_rule

Manages a Config Organization Managed Rule. More information about these rules can be found in the [Enabling AWS Config Rules Across all Accounts in Your Organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/config-rule-multi-account-deployment.html) and [AWS Config Managed Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config_use-managed-rules.html) documentation. For working with Organization Custom Rules (those invoking a custom Lambda Function), see the [`aws_config_organization_custom_rule` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/config_organization_custom_rule.html).

~> **NOTE:** This resource must be created in the Organization master account and rules will include the master account unless its ID is added to the `excluded_accounts` argument.

~> **NOTE:** Every Organization account except those configured in the `excluded_accounts` argument must have a Configuration Recorder with proper IAM permissions before the rule will successfully create or update. See also the [`aws_config_configuration_recorder` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/config_configuration_recorder.html).

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.config_organization_managed_rule import ConfigOrganizationManagedRule
from imports.aws.organizations_organization import OrganizationsOrganization
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = OrganizationsOrganization(self, "example",
            aws_service_access_principals=["config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com"],
            feature_set="ALL"
        )
        aws_config_organization_managed_rule_example =
        ConfigOrganizationManagedRule(self, "example_1",
            depends_on=[example],
            name="example",
            rule_identifier="IAM_PASSWORD_POLICY"
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_config_organization_managed_rule_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `create` - (Default `5m`)
* `delete` - (Default `5m`)
* `update` - (Default `5m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Config Organization Managed Rules using the name. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.config_organization_managed_rule import ConfigOrganizationManagedRule
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        ConfigOrganizationManagedRule.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "example")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Config Organization Managed Rules using the name. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_config_organization_managed_rule.example example
```
