# Resource: aws_glue_trigger

Manages a Glue Trigger resource.

## Example Usage

### Conditional Trigger

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.glue_trigger import GlueTrigger
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        GlueTrigger(self, "example",
            actions=[GlueTriggerActions(
                job_name=example1.name
            )
            ],
            name="example",
            predicate=GlueTriggerPredicate(
                conditions=[GlueTriggerPredicateConditions(
                    job_name=example2.name,
                    state="SUCCEEDED"
                )
                ]
            ),
            type="CONDITIONAL"
        )
```

### On-Demand Trigger

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug

### Conditional Trigger with Crawler Action

**Note:** Triggers can have both a crawler action and a crawler condition, just no example provided.

from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.

            )
            ],
            name="example",
            predicate=GlueTriggerPredicate(

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `actions` – (Required) List of actions initiated by this trigger when it fires. See [Actions](#actions) Below.
* `description` – (Optional) A description of the new trigger.
* `enabled` – (Optional) Start the trigger. Defaults to `true`.
* `name` – (Required) The name of the trigger.
* `predicate` – (Optional) A predicate to specify when the new trigger should fire. Required when trigger type is `CONDITIONAL`. See [Predicate](#predicate) Below.
* `schedule` – (Optional) A cron expression used to specify the schedule. [Time-Based Schedules for Jobs and Crawlers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/monitor-data-warehouse-schedule.html)
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `start_on_creation` – (Optional) Set to true to start `SCHEDULED` and `CONDITIONAL` triggers when created. True is not supported for `ON_DEMAND` triggers.
* `type` – (Required) The type of trigger. Valid values are `CONDITIONAL`, `EVENT`, `ON_DEMAND`, and `SCHEDULED`.
* `workflow_name` - (Optional) A workflow to which the trigger should be associated to. Every workflow graph (DAG) needs a starting trigger (`ON_DEMAND` or `SCHEDULED` type) and can contain multiple additional `CONDITIONAL` triggers.
* `event_batching_condition` - (Optional) Batch condition that must be met (specified number of events received or batch time window expired) before EventBridge event trigger fires. See [Event Batching Condition](#event-batching-condition).

### Actions

* `arguments` - (Optional) Arguments to be passed to the job. You can specify arguments here that your own job-execution script consumes, as well as arguments that AWS Glue itself consumes.
* `crawler_name` - (Optional) The name of the crawler to be executed. Conflicts with `job_name`.
* `job_name` - (Optional) The name of a job to be executed. Conflicts with `crawler_name`.
* `timeout` - (Optional) The job run timeout in minutes. It overrides the timeout value of the job.
* `security_configuration` - (Optional) The name of the Security Configuration structure to be used with this action.
* `notification_property` - (Optional) Specifies configuration properties of a job run notification. See [Notification Property](#notification-property) details below.

#### Notification Property

* `notify_delay_after` - (Optional) After a job run starts, the number of minutes to wait before sending a job run delay notification.

### Predicate

* `conditions` - (Required) A list of the conditions that determine when the trigger will fire. See [Conditions](#conditions).
* `logical` - (Optional) How to handle multiple conditions. Defaults to `AND`. Valid values are `AND` or `ANY`.

#### Conditions

* `job_name` - (Optional) The name of the job to watch. If this is specified, `state` must also be specified. Conflicts with `crawler_name`.
* `state` - (Optional) The condition job state. Currently, the values supported are `SUCCEEDED`, `STOPPED`, `TIMEOUT` and `FAILED`. If this is specified, `job_name` must also be specified. Conflicts with `crawler_state`.
* `crawler_name` - (Optional) The name of the crawler to watch. If this is specified, `crawl_state` must also be specified. Conflicts with `job_name`.
* `crawl_state` - (Optional) The condition crawl state. Currently, the values supported are `RUNNING`, `SUCCEEDED`, `CANCELLED`, and `FAILED`. If this is specified, `crawler_name` must also be specified. Conflicts with `state`.
* `logical_operator` - (Optional) A logical operator. Defaults to `EQUALS`.

### Event Batching Condition

* `batch_size` - (Required)Number of events that must be received from Amazon EventBridge before EventBridge  event trigger fires.
* `batch_window` - (Optional) Window of time in seconds after which EventBridge event trigger fires. Window starts when first event is received. Default value is `900`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of Glue Trigger
* `id` - Trigger name
* `state` - The current state of the trigger.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

- `create` - (Default `5m`)
- `update` - (Default `5m`)
- `delete` - (Default `5m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Glue Triggers using `name`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.glue_trigger import GlueTrigger
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        GlueTrigger.generate_config_for_import(self, "myTrigger", "MyTrigger")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Glue Triggers using `name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_glue_trigger.MyTrigger MyTrigger
```
