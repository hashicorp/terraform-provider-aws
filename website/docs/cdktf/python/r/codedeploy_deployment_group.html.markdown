# Resource: aws_codedeploy_deployment_group

Provides a CodeDeploy Deployment Group for a CodeDeploy Application

~> **NOTE on blue/green deployments:** When using `green_fleet_provisioning_option` with the `COPY_AUTO_SCALING_GROUP` action, CodeDeploy will create a new ASG with a different name. This ASG is _not_ managed by terraform and will conflict with existing configuration and state. You may want to use a different approach to managing deployments that involve multiple ASG, such as `DISCOVER_EXISTING` with separate blue and green ASG.

## Example Usage

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import CodeDeploy Deployment Groups using `app_name`, a colon, and `deployment_group_name`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.codedeploy_deployment_group import CodedeployDeploymentGroup
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CodedeployDeploymentGroup.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "my-application:my-deployment-group")
```

Using `terraform import`, import CodeDeploy Deployment Groups using `app_name`, a colon, and `deployment_group_name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_codedeploy_deployment_group.example my-application:my-deployment-group
```
