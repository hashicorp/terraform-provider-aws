# Resource: aws_worklink_fleet

Provides a AWS WorkLink Fleet resource.

!> **WARNING:** The `aws_worklink_fleet` resource has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use Amazon WorkSpaces Secure Browser instead.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.worklink_fleet import WorklinkFleet
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        WorklinkFleet(self, "example",
            name="terraform-example"
        )
```

Network Configuration Usage:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Fn, Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.worklink_fleet import WorklinkFleet
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        WorklinkFleet(self, "example",
            name="terraform-example",
            network=WorklinkFleetNetwork(
                security_group_ids=[test.id],
                subnet_ids=[
                    Token.as_string(Fn.lookup_nested(aws_subnet_test, ["*", "id"]))
                ],
                vpc_id=Token.as_string(aws_vpc_test.id)
            )
        )
```

Identity Provider Configuration Usage:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Fn, Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.worklink_fleet import WorklinkFleet
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        WorklinkFleet(self, "test",
            identity_provider=WorklinkFleetIdentityProvider(
                saml_metadata=Token.as_string(Fn.file("saml-metadata.xml")),
                type="SAML"
            ),
            name="tf-worklink-fleet"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

* `vpc_id` - (Required) The VPC ID with connectivity to associated websites.
* `subnet_ids` - (Required) A list of subnet IDs used for X-ENI connections from Amazon WorkLink rendering containers.
* `security_group_ids` - (Required) A list of security group IDs associated with access to the provided subnets.

**identity_provider** requires the following:

~> **NOTE:** `identity_provider` cannot be removed without force recreating by `terraform taint`.

* `type` - (Required) The type of identity provider.
* `saml_metadata` - (Required) The SAML metadata document provided by the customerâ€™s identity provider.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The ARN of the created WorkLink Fleet.
* `arn` - The ARN of the created WorkLink Fleet.
* `company_code` - The identifier used by users to sign in to the Amazon WorkLink app.
* `created_time` - The time that the fleet was created.
* `last_updated_time` - The time that the fleet was last updated.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import WorkLink using the ARN. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.worklink_fleet import WorklinkFleet
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        WorklinkFleet.generate_config_for_import(self, "test", "arn:aws:worklink::123456789012:fleet/example")
```

Using `terraform import`, import WorkLink using the ARN. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_worklink_fleet.test arn:aws:worklink::123456789012:fleet/example
```
