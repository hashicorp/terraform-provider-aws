# Resource: aws_codecommit_trigger

Provides a CodeCommit Trigger Resource.

~> **NOTE:** Terraform currently can create only one trigger per repository, even if multiple aws_codecommit_trigger resources are defined. Moreover, creating triggers with Terraform will delete all other triggers in the repository (also manually-created triggers).

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.codecommit_repository import CodecommitRepository
from imports.aws.codecommit_trigger import CodecommitTrigger
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        test = CodecommitRepository(self, "test",
            repository_name="test"
        )
        aws_codecommit_trigger_test = CodecommitTrigger(self, "test_1",
            repository_name=test.repository_name,
            trigger=[CodecommitTriggerTrigger(
                destination_arn=Token.as_string(aws_sns_topic_test.arn),
                events=["all"],
                name="all"
            )
            ]
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_codecommit_trigger_test.override_logical_id("test")
```
