# Resource: aws_s3_bucket_logging

Provides an S3 bucket (server access) logging resource. For more information, see [Logging requests using server access logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerLogs.html)
in the AWS S3 User Guide.

~> **Note:** Amazon S3 supports server access logging, AWS CloudTrail, or a combination of both. Refer to the [Logging options for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/logging-with-S3.html)
to decide which method meets your requirements.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.

from imports.aws.s3_bucket import S3Bucket
from imports.aws.s3_bucket_acl import S3BucketAcl
from imports.aws.s3_bucket_logging import S3BucketLoggingA
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = S3Bucket(self, "example",
            bucket="my-tf-example-bucket"
        )
        log_bucket = S3Bucket(self, "log_bucket",
            bucket="my-tf-log-bucket"
        )
        aws_s3_bucket_acl_example = S3BucketAcl(self, "example_2",
            acl="private",
            bucket=example.id
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_s3_bucket_acl_example.override_logical_id("example")
        S3BucketAcl(self, "log_bucket_acl",
            acl="log-delivery-write",
            bucket=log_bucket.id
        )
        aws_s3_bucket_logging_example = S3BucketLoggingA(self, "example_4",
            bucket=example.id,
            target_bucket=log_bucket.id,
            target_prefix="log/"
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `bucket` - (Required, Forces new resource) Name of the bucket.
* `expected_bucket_owner` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Account ID of the expected bucket owner.
* `target_bucket` - (Required) Name of the bucket where you want Amazon S3 to store server access logs.
* `target_prefix` - (Required) Prefix for all log object keys.
* `target_grant` - (Optional) Set of configuration blocks with information for granting permissions. [See below](#target_grant).

### target_grant

The `target_grant` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `grantee` - (Required) Configuration block for the person being granted permissions. [See below](#grantee).
* `permission` - (Required) Logging permissions assigned to the grantee for the bucket. Valid values: `FULL_CONTROL`, `READ`, `WRITE`.

### grantee

The `grantee` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `email_address` - (Optional) Email address of the grantee. See [Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region) for supported AWS regions where this argument can be specified.
* `id` - (Optional) Canonical user ID of the grantee.
* `type` - (Required) Type of grantee. Valid values: `CanonicalUser`, `AmazonCustomerByEmail`, `Group`.
* `uri` - (Optional) URI of the grantee group.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The `bucket` or `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`) if the latter is provided.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import S3 bucket logging using the `bucket` or using the `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`). For example:

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket is the same account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket`:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket differs from the account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`):

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

**Using `terraform import` to import** S3 bucket logging using the `bucket` or using the `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`). For example:

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket is the same account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket`:

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_logging.example bucket-name
```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket differs from the account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`):

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_logging.example bucket-name,123456789012
```
