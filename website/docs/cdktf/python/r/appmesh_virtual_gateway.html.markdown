## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import App Mesh virtual gateway using `mesh_name` together with the virtual gateway's `name`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Using `terraform import`, import App Mesh virtual gateway using `mesh_name` together with the virtual gateway's `name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_appmesh_virtual_gateway.example mesh/gw1
```
