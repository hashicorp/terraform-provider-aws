# Resource: aws_appmesh_virtual_node

Provides an AWS App Mesh virtual node resource.

## Breaking Changes

Because of backward incompatible API changes (read [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-app-mesh-examples/issues/92)), `aws_appmesh_virtual_node` resource definitions created with provider versions earlier than v2.3.0 will need to be modified:

* Rename the `service_name` attribute of the `dns` object to `hostname`.

* Replace the `backends` attribute of the `spec` object with one or more `backend` configuration blocks,
setting `virtual_service_name` to the name of the service.

The Terraform state associated with existing resources will automatically be migrated.

## Example Usage

### Basic

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import App Mesh virtual nodes using `mesh_name` together with the virtual node's `name`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.appmesh_virtual_node import AppmeshVirtualNode
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        AppmeshVirtualNode.generate_config_for_import(self, "serviceb1", "simpleapp/serviceBv1")
```

Using `terraform import`, import App Mesh virtual nodes using `mesh_name` together with the virtual node's `name`. For example:

```console
