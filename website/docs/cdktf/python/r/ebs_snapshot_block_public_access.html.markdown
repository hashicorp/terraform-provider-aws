# Resource: aws_ebs_snapshot_block_public_access

Provides a resource to manage the state of the "Block public access for snapshots" setting on region level.

~> **NOTE:** Removing this Terraform resource disables blocking.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.ebs_snapshot_block_public_access import EbsSnapshotBlockPublicAccess
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        EbsSnapshotBlockPublicAccess(self, "example",
            state="block-all-sharing"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

* `state` - (Required) The mode in which to enable "Block public access for snapshots" for the region. Allowed values are `block-all-sharing`, `block-new-sharing`, `unblocked`.

## Attribute Reference

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import the current state. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.ebs_snapshot_block_public_access import EbsSnapshotBlockPublicAccess
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        EbsSnapshotBlockPublicAccess.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "default")
```

Using `terraform import`, import the state. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_ebs_snapshot_block_public_access.example default
```
