```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `component` - Ordered configuration block(s) with components for the image recipe. Detailed below.
* `name` - Name of the image recipe.
* `parent_image` - The image recipe uses this image as a base from which to build your customized image. The value can be the base image ARN or an AMI ID.
* `version` - The semantic version of the image recipe, which specifies the version in the following format, with numeric values in each position to indicate a specific version: major.minor.patch. For example: 1.0.0.

The following attributes are optional:

* `block_device_mapping` - Configuration block(s) with block device mappings for the image recipe. Detailed below.
* `description` - Description of the image recipe.
* `systems_manager_agent` - Configuration block for the Systems Manager Agent installed by default by Image Builder. Detailed below.
* `tags` - Key-value map of resource tags for the image recipe. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `user_data_base64` Base64 encoded user data. Use this to provide commands or a command script to run when you launch your build instance.
* `working_directory` - The working directory to be used during build and test workflows.

### block_device_mapping

The following arguments are optional:

* `device_name` - Name of the device. For example, `/dev/sda` or `/dev/xvdb`.
* `ebs` - Configuration block with Elastic Block Storage (EBS) block device mapping settings. Detailed below.
* `no_device` - Set to `true` to remove a mapping from the parent image.
* `virtual_name` - Virtual device name. For example, `ephemeral0`. Instance store volumes are numbered starting from 0.

#### ebs

The following arguments are optional:

* `delete_on_termination` - Whether to delete the volume on termination. Defaults to unset, which is the value inherited from the parent image.
* `encrypted` - Whether to encrypt the volume. Defaults to unset, which is the value inherited from the parent image.
* `iops` - Number of Input/Output (I/O) operations per second to provision for an `io1` or `io2` volume.
* `kms_key_id` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Key Management Service (KMS) Key for encryption.
* `snapshot_id` - Identifier of the EC2 Volume Snapshot.
* `throughput` - For GP3 volumes only. The throughput in MiB/s that the volume supports.
* `volume_size` - Size of the volume, in GiB.
* `volume_type` - Type of the volume. For example, `gp2` or `io2`.

### component

The `component` block supports the following arguments:

* `component_arn` - (Required) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Image Builder Component to associate.
* `parameter` - (Optional) Configuration block(s) for parameters to configure the component. Detailed below.

### parameter

The following arguments are required:

* `name` - The name of the component parameter.
* `value` - The value for the named component parameter.

### systems_manager_agent

The following arguments are required:

* `uninstall_after_build` - Whether to remove the Systems Manager Agent after the image has been built. Defaults to `false`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - (Required) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image recipe.
* `date_created` - Date the image recipe was created.
* `owner` - Owner of the image recipe.
* `platform` - Platform of the image recipe.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_imagebuilder_image_recipe` resources using the Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.imagebuilder_image_recipe import ImagebuilderImageRecipe
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        ImagebuilderImageRecipe.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-east-1:123456789012:image-recipe/example/1.0.0")
```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_imagebuilder_image_recipe` resources using the Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_imagebuilder_image_recipe.example arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-east-1:123456789012:image-recipe/example/1.0.0
```
