# Resource: aws_lightsail_lb_stickiness_policy

Manages session stickiness for a Lightsail Load Balancer.

Use this resource to configure session stickiness to ensure that user sessions are consistently routed to the same backend instance. This helps maintain session state for applications that store session data locally on the server.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.lightsail_lb import LightsailLb
from imports.aws.lightsail_lb_stickiness_policy import LightsailLbStickinessPolicy
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = LightsailLb(self, "example",
            health_check_path="/",
            instance_port=Token.as_number("80"),
            name="example-load-balancer",
            tags={
                "foo": "bar"
            }
        )
        aws_lightsail_lb_stickiness_policy_example =
        LightsailLbStickinessPolicy(self, "example_1",
            cookie_duration=900,
            enabled=True,
            lb_name=example.name
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_lightsail_lb_stickiness_policy_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `cookie_duration` - (Required) Cookie duration in seconds. This determines the length of the session stickiness.
* `enabled` - (Required) Whether to enable session stickiness for the load balancer.
* `lb_name` - (Required) Name of the load balancer to which you want to enable session stickiness.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - Name used for this load balancer (matches `lb_name`).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_lightsail_lb_stickiness_policy` using the `lb_name` attribute. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.lightsail_lb_stickiness_policy import LightsailLbStickinessPolicy
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        LightsailLbStickinessPolicy.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "example-load-balancer")
```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_lightsail_lb_stickiness_policy` using the `lb_name` attribute. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_lightsail_lb_stickiness_policy.example example-load-balancer
```
