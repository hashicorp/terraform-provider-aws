from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.

#
from imports.aws.backup_vault_lock_configuration import BackupVaultLockConfiguration
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        BackupVaultLockConfiguration.generate_config_for_import(self, "test", "TestVault")
