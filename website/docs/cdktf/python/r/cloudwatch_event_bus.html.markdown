# Resource: aws_cloudwatch_event_bus

Provides an EventBridge event bus resource.

~> **Note:** EventBridge was formerly known as CloudWatch Events. The functionality is identical.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.cloudwatch_event_bus import CloudwatchEventBus
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CloudwatchEventBus(self, "messenger",
            name="chat-messages"
        )
```

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.cloudwatch_event_bus import CloudwatchEventBus
from imports.aws.data_aws_cloudwatch_event_source import DataAwsCloudwatchEventSource
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        examplepartner = DataAwsCloudwatchEventSource(self, "examplepartner",
            name_prefix="aws.partner/examplepartner.com"
        )
        aws_cloudwatch_event_bus_examplepartner = CloudwatchEventBus(self, "examplepartner_1",
            event_source_name=Token.as_string(examplepartner.name),
            name=Token.as_string(examplepartner.name)
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_cloudwatch_event_bus_examplepartner.override_logical_id("examplepartner")
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the new event bus. The names of custom event buses can't contain the / character. To create a partner event bus, ensure the `name` matches the `event_source_name`.
* `event_source_name` - (Optional) The partner event source that the new event bus will be matched with. Must match `name`.
* `kms_key_identifier` - (Optional) The identifier of the AWS KMS customer managed key for EventBridge to use, if you choose to use a customer managed key to encrypt events on this event bus. The identifier can be the key Amazon Resource Name (ARN), KeyId, key alias, or key alias ARN.
* `tags` - (Optional)  A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the event bus.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import EventBridge event buses using the `name` (which can also be a partner event source name). For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.cloudwatch_event_bus import CloudwatchEventBus
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CloudwatchEventBus.generate_config_for_import(self, "messenger", "chat-messages")
```

Using `terraform import`, import EventBridge event buses using the `name` (which can also be a partner event source name). For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_cloudwatch_event_bus.messenger chat-messages
```
