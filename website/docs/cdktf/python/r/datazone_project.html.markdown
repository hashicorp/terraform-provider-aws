#
from imports.aws.datazone_project import DatazoneProject
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name, *, domainIdentifier):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DatazoneProject(self, "test",
            description="desc",
            domain_id=aws_datazone_domain_test.id,
            glossary_terms=["2N8w6XJCwZf"],
            name="name",
            skip_deletion_check=True,

        )
```

### Basic Usage

```python

from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.datazone_project import DatazoneProject
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DatazoneProject(self, "test",
            domain_identifier=Token.as_string(aws_datazone_domain_test.id),
            name="name"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import DataZone Project using the `id`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.datazone_project import DatazoneProject
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DatazoneProject.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "projectid123")
```

Using `terraform import`, import DataZone Project using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_datazone_project.example projectid123
```
