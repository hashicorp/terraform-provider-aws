#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.cleanrooms_collaboration import CleanroomsCollaboration
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CleanroomsCollaboration.generate_config_for_import(self, "collaboration", "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab")
```

Using `terraform import`, import `aws_cleanrooms_collaboration` using the `id`. For example:
