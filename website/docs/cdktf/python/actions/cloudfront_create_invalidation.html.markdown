# Action: aws_cloudfront_create_invalidation

~> **Note:** `aws_cloudfront_create_invalidation` is in beta. Its interface and behavior may change as the feature evolves, and breaking changes are possible. It is offered as a technical preview without compatibility guarantees until Terraform 1.14 is generally available.

Invalidates CloudFront distribution cache for specified paths. This action creates an invalidation request and waits for it to complete.

For information about CloudFront cache invalidation, see the [Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Invalidation.html). For specific information about creating invalidation requests, see the [CreateInvalidation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_CreateInvalidation.html) page in the Amazon CloudFront API Reference.

~> **Note:** CloudFront invalidation requests can take several minutes to complete. This action will wait for the invalidation to finish before continuing. You can only have a limited number of invalidation requests in progress at any given time.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from cdktf import TerraformResourceLifecycle
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import DataResource, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.cloudfront_distribution import CloudfrontDistribution
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name, *, defaultCacheBehavior, enabled, origin, restrictions, viewerCertificate):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CloudfrontDistribution(self, "example",
            default_cache_behavior=default_cache_behavior,
            enabled=enabled,
            origin=origin,
            restrictions=restrictions,
            viewer_certificate=viewer_certificate
        )
        terraform_data_example = DataResource(self, "example_1",
            input="trigger-invalidation",
            lifecycle=TerraformResourceLifecycle(
                action_trigger=[{
                    "actions": [aws_cloudfront_create_invalidation.example],
                    "events": [before_create, before_update]
                }
                ]
            )
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        terraform_data_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

### Invalidate Specific Paths

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

### With Custom Caller Reference

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

Use this action in your deployment pipeline to invalidate cache after updating static assets:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from cdktf import TerraformResourceLifecycle
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import DataResource, TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataResource(self, "deploy_complete",
            depends_on=[assets],
            input=deployment_id,
            lifecycle=TerraformResourceLifecycle(
                action_trigger=[{
                    "actions": [aws_cloudfront_create_invalidation.post_deploy],
                    "events": [before_create, before_update]
                }
                ]
            )
        )
```

### Environment-Specific Invalidation

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

## Argument Reference

This action supports the following arguments:

* `distribution_id` - (Required) ID of the CloudFront distribution to invalidate cache for. Must be a valid CloudFront distribution ID (e.g., E1GHKQ2EXAMPLE).
* `paths` - (Required) List of file paths or patterns to invalidate. Use `/*` to invalidate all files. Supports specific files (`/index.html`), directory wildcards (`/images/*`), or all files (`/*`). Maximum of 3000 paths per invalidation request. Note: The first 1,000 invalidation paths per month are free, additional paths are charged per path.
* `caller_reference` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the invalidation request. If not provided, one will be generated automatically. Maximum length of 128 characters.
* `timeout` - (Optional) Timeout in seconds to wait for the invalidation to complete. Defaults to 900 seconds (15 minutes). Must be between 60 and 3600 seconds. Invalidation requests typically take 5-15 minutes to process.
