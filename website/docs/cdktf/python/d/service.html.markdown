# Data Source: aws_service

Use this data source to compose and decompose AWS service DNS names.

## Example Usage

### Get Service DNS Name

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_region import DataAwsRegion
from imports.aws.data_aws_service import DataAwsService
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        current = DataAwsRegion(self, "current")
        DataAwsService(self, "test",
            region=Token.as_string(current.name),
            service_id="ec2"
        )
```

### Use Service Reverse DNS Name to Get Components

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_service import DataAwsService
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsService(self, "s3",
            reverse_dns_name="cn.com.amazonaws.cn-north-1.s3"
        )
```

### Determine Regional Support for a Service

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_service import DataAwsService
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsService(self, "s3",
            reverse_dns_name="com.amazonaws.us-gov-west-1.waf"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are optional:

* `dns_name` - (Optional) DNS name of the service (_e.g.,_ `rds.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`). One of `dns_name`, `reverse_dns_name`, or `service_id` is required.
* `partition` - (Optional) Partition corresponding to the region.
* `region` - (Optional) Region of the service (_e.g.,_ `us-west-2`, `ap-northeast-1`).
* `reverse_dns_name` - (Optional) Reverse DNS name of the service (_e.g.,_ `com.amazonaws.us-west-2.s3`). One of `dns_name`, `reverse_dns_name`, or `service_id` is required.
* `reverse_dns_prefix` - (Optional) Prefix of the service (_e.g.,_ `com.amazonaws` in AWS Commercial, `cn.com.amazonaws` in AWS China).
* `service_id` - (Optional) Service (_e.g.,_ `s3`, `rds`, `ec2`). One of `dns_name`, `reverse_dns_name`, or `service_id` is required.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `supported` - Whether the service is supported in the region's partition. New services may not be listed immediately as supported.
