# Data Source: aws_cloudwatch_event_source

Use this data source to get information about an EventBridge Partner Event Source. This data source will only return one partner event source. An error will be returned if multiple sources match the same name prefix.

~> **Note:** EventBridge was formerly known as CloudWatch Events. The functionality is identical.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_cloudwatch_event_source import DataAwsCloudwatchEventSource
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsCloudwatchEventSource(self, "examplepartner",
