# Data Source: aws_ec2_transit_gateway_route_tables

Provides information for multiple EC2 Transit Gateway Route Tables, such as their identifiers.

## Example Usage

The following shows outputting all Transit Gateway Route Table Ids.

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformOutput, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_ec2_transit_gateway_route_tables import DataAwsEc2TransitGatewayRouteTables
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = DataAwsEc2TransitGatewayRouteTables(self, "example")
        cdktf_terraform_output_example = TerraformOutput(self, "example_1",
            value=example.ids
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        cdktf_terraform_output_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.

* `tags` - (Optional) Mapping of tags, each pair of which must exactly match
  a pair on the desired transit gateway route table.

More complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,
which take the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by
  [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeTransitGatewayRouteTables.html).

* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field.
  A Transit Gateway Route Table will be selected if any one of the given values matches.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - AWS Region.
* `ids` - Set of Transit Gateway Route Table identifiers.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

- `read` - (Default `20m`)
