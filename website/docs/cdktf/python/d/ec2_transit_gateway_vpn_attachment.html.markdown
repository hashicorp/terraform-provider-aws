# Data Source: aws_ec2_transit_gateway_vpn_attachment

Get information on an EC2 Transit Gateway VPN Attachment.

-> EC2 Transit Gateway VPN Attachments are implicitly created by VPN Connections referencing an EC2 Transit Gateway so there is no managed resource. For ease, the [`aws_vpn_connection` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/vpn_connection.html) includes a `transit_gateway_attachment_id` attribute which can replace some usage of this data source. For tagging the attachment, see the [`aws_ec2_tag` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/ec2_tag.html).

## Example Usage

### By Transit Gateway and VPN Connection Identifiers

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_ec2_transit_gateway_vpn_attachment import DataAwsEc2TransitGatewayVpnAttachment
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsEc2TransitGatewayVpnAttachment(self, "example",
            transit_gateway_id=Token.as_string(aws_ec2_transit_gateway_example.id),
            vpn_connection_id=Token.as_string(aws_vpn_connection_example.id)
        )
```

### Filter

        DataAwsEc2TransitGatewayVpnAttachment(self, "test",
            filter=[DataAwsEc2TransitGatewayVpnAttachmentFilter(
                name="resource-id",
                values=["some-resource"]
            )
            ]
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `transit_gateway_id` - (Optional) Identifier of the EC2 Transit Gateway.
* `vpn_connection_id` - (Optional) Identifier of the EC2 VPN Connection.
* `filter` - (Optional) Configuration block(s) for filtering. Detailed below.
* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match a pair on the desired Transit Gateway VPN Attachment.

### filter Configuration Block

The `filter` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the filter field. Valid values can be found in the [EC2 DescribeTransitGatewayAttachments API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeTransitGatewayAttachments.html).
* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given filter field. Results will be selected if any given value matches.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - EC2 Transit Gateway VPN Attachment identifier
* `tags` - Key-value tags for the EC2 Transit Gateway VPN Attachment

## Timeouts
