# Data Source: aws_ssm_patch_baseline

Provides an SSM Patch Baseline data source. Useful if you wish to reuse the default baselines provided.

## Example Usage

To retrieve a baseline provided by AWS:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_ssm_patch_baseline import DataAwsSsmPatchBaseline
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsSsmPatchBaseline(self, "centos",
            name_prefix="AWS-",
            operating_system="CENTOS",
            owner="AWS"
        )
```

To retrieve a baseline on your account:

```python

from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.

from imports.aws.data_aws_ssm_patch_baseline import DataAwsSsmPatchBaseline
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsSsmPatchBaseline(self, "default_custom",
            default_baseline=True,
            name_prefix="MyCustomBaseline",
            operating_system="WINDOWS",
            owner="Self"
