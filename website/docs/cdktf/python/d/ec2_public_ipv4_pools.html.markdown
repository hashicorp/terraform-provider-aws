# Data Source: aws_ec2_public_ipv4_pools

Terraform data source for getting information about AWS EC2 Public IPv4 Pools.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_ec2_public_ipv4_pools import DataAwsEc2PublicIpv4Pools
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsEc2PublicIpv4Pools(self, "example")
```

### Usage with Filter

```python

from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_ec2_public_ipv4_pools import DataAwsEc2PublicIpv4Pools
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsEc2PublicIpv4Pools(self, "example",
            filter=[DataAwsEc2PublicIpv4PoolsFilter(
                name="tag-key",
                values=["ExampleTagKey"]
            )
            ]
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are optional:

* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.
* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match a pair on the desired pools.

More complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,
which take the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribePublicIpv4Pools.html).
* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field. Pool IDs will be selected if any one of the given values match.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `pool_ids` - List of all the pool IDs found.
