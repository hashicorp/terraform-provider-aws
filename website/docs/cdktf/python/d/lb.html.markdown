# Data Source: aws_lb

~> **Note:** `aws_alb` is known as `aws_lb`. The functionality is identical.

Provides information about a Load Balancer.

This data source can prove useful when a module accepts an LB as an input
variable and needs to, for example, determine the security groups associated
with it, etc.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import VariableType, TerraformVariable, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_lb import DataAwsLb
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        # Terraform Variables are not always the best fit for getting inputs in the context of Terraform CDK.
        #     You can read more about this at https://cdk.tf/variables
        lb_arn = TerraformVariable(self, "lb_arn",
            default="",
            type=VariableType.STRING
        )
        lb_name = TerraformVariable(self, "lb_name",
            default="",
            type=VariableType.STRING
        )
        DataAwsLb(self, "test",
            arn=lb_arn.string_value,
            name=lb_name.string_value
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `arn` - (Optional) Full ARN of the load balancer.
* `name` - (Optional) Unique name of the load balancer.
* `tags` - (Optional) Mapping of tags, each pair of which must exactly match a pair on the desired load balancer.

~> **NOTE:** When both `arn` and `name` are specified, `arn` takes precedence. `tags` has lowest precedence.

## Attribute Reference

See the [LB Resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/lb.html) for details on the
returned attributes - they are identical.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

- `read` - (Default `20m`)
