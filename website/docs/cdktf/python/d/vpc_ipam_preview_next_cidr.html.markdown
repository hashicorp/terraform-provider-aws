# Data Source: aws_vpc_ipam_preview_next_cidr

Previews a CIDR from an IPAM address pool. Only works for private IPv4.

~> **NOTE:** This functionality is also encapsulated in a resource sharing the same name. The data source can be used when you need to use the cidr in a calculation of the same Root module, `count` for example. However, once a cidr range has been allocated that was previewed, the next refresh will find a **new** cidr and may force new resources downstream. Make sure to use Terraform's lifecycle `ignore_changes` policy if this is undesirable.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from cdktf import TerraformResourceLifecycle
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_vpc_ipam_preview_next_cidr import DataAwsVpcIpamPreviewNextCidr
from imports.aws.vpc_ipam_pool_cidr_allocation import VpcIpamPoolCidrAllocation
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        test = DataAwsVpcIpamPreviewNextCidr(self, "test",
            depends_on=[aws_vpc_ipam_pool_cidr_test],
            ipam_pool_id=Token.as_string(aws_vpc_ipam_pool_test.id),
            netmask_length=28
        )
        aws_vpc_ipam_pool_cidr_allocation_test = VpcIpamPoolCidrAllocation(self, "test_1",
            cidr=Token.as_string(test.cidr),
            ipam_pool_id=Token.as_string(aws_vpc_ipam_pool_test.id),
            lifecycle=TerraformResourceLifecycle(
                ignore_changes=[cidr]
            )
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_vpc_ipam_pool_cidr_allocation_test.override_logical_id("test")
```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `disallowed_cidrs` - (Optional) Exclude a particular CIDR range from being returned by the pool.
* `ipam_pool_id` - (Required) ID of the pool to which you want to assign a CIDR.
* `netmask_length` - (Optional) Netmask length of the CIDR you would like to preview from the IPAM pool.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `cidr` - Previewed CIDR from the pool.
* `id` - ID of the preview.
