# Data Source: aws_sfn_state_machine

Use this data source to get the ARN of a State Machine in AWS Step
Function (SFN). By using this data source, you can reference a
state machine without having to hard code the ARNs as input.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_sfn_state_machine import DataAwsSfnStateMachine
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsSfnStateMachine(self, "example",
            name="an_example_sfn_name"
        )
```
