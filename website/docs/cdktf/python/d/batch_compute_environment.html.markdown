# Data Source: aws_batch_compute_environment

The Batch Compute Environment data source allows access to details of a specific
compute environment within AWS Batch.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_batch_compute_environment import DataAwsBatchComputeEnvironment
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsBatchComputeEnvironment(self, "batch-mongo",
            name="batch-mongo-production"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `region` - (Optional) Region where this resource will be [managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints). Defaults to the Region set in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#aws-configuration-reference).
* `name` - (Required) Name of the Batch Compute Environment

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - ARN of the compute environment.
* `ecs_cluster_arn` - ARN of the underlying Amazon ECS cluster used by the compute environment.
* `service_role` - ARN of the IAM role that allows AWS Batch to make calls to other AWS services on your behalf.
* `type` - Type of the compute environment (for example, `MANAGED` or `UNMANAGED`).
* `status` - Current status of the compute environment (for example, `CREATING` or `VALID`).
* `status_reason` - Short, human-readable string to provide additional details about the current status of the compute environment.
* `state` - State of the compute environment (for example, `ENABLED` or `DISABLED`). If the state is `ENABLED`, then the compute environment accepts jobs from a queue and can scale out automatically based on queues.
* `update_policy` - Specifies the infrastructure update policy for the compute environment.
* `tags` - Key-value map of resource tags
