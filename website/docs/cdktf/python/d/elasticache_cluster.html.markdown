# Data Source: aws_elasticache_cluster

Use this data source to get information about an ElastiCache Cluster

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_elasticache_cluster import DataAwsElasticacheCluster
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsElasticacheCluster(self, "my_cluster",
            cluster_id="my-cluster-id"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `cluster_id` – (Required) Group identifier.

## Attribute Reference

* `node_type` – The cluster node type.
* `num_cache_nodes` – The number of cache nodes that the cache cluster has.
* `engine` – Name of the cache engine.
* `engine_version` – Version number of the cache engine.
* `ip_discovery` - The IP version advertised in the discovery protocol.
* `network_type` - The IP versions for cache cluster connections.
* `subnet_group_name` – Name of the subnet group associated to the cache cluster.
* `security_group_ids` – List VPC security groups associated with the cache cluster.
* `parameter_group_name` – Name of the parameter group associated with this cache cluster.
* `replication_group_id` - The replication group to which this cache cluster belongs.
* `log_delivery_configuration` - Redis [SLOWLOG](https://redis.io/commands/slowlog) or Redis [Engine Log](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/Log_Delivery.html#Log_contents-engine-log) delivery settings.
* `maintenance_window` – Specifies the weekly time range for when maintenance
on the cache cluster is performed.
* `snapshot_window` - Daily time range (in UTC) during which ElastiCache will
begin taking a daily snapshot of the cache cluster.
* `snapshot_retention_limit` - The number of days for which ElastiCache will
retain automatic cache cluster snapshots before deleting them.
* `availability_zone` - Availability Zone for the cache cluster.
* `notification_topic_arn` – An ARN of an
SNS topic that ElastiCache notifications get sent to.
* `port` – The port number on which each of the cache nodes will
accept connections.
* `configuration_endpoint` - (Memcached only) Configuration endpoint to allow host discovery.
* `cluster_address` - (Memcached only) DNS name of the cache cluster without the port appended.
* `preferred_outpost_arn` - The outpost ARN in which the cache cluster was created if created in outpost.
* `cache_nodes` - List of node objects including `id`, `address`, `port`, `availability_zone` and `outpost_arn`.
