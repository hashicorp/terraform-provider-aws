from imports.aws.data_aws_eips import DataAwsEips
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = DataAwsEips(self, "example",
            tags={
                "Env": "dev"
            }
        )
        TerraformOutput(self, "allocation_ids",
            value=example.allocation_ids
        )
        TerraformOutput(self, "public_ips",
            value=example.public_ips
        )
```
