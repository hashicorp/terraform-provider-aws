This data source allows to find a Hosted Zone ID given Hosted Zone name and certain search criteria.

## Example Usage

The following example shows how to get a Hosted Zone from its name and from this data how to create a Record Set.

```python

from imports.aws.data_aws_route53_zone import DataAwsRoute53Zone
from imports.aws.route53_record import Route53Record
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        selected = DataAwsRoute53Zone(self, "selected",
            name="test.com.",
            private_zone=True
        )
        Route53Record(self, "www",
            name="www.${" + selected.name + "}",
            records=["10.0.0.1"],
            ttl=Token.as_number("300"),
            type="A",
            zone_id=Token.as_string(selected.zone_id)
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The arguments of this data source act as filters for querying the available
Hosted Zone. You have to use `zone_id` or `name`, not both of them. The given filter must match exactly one
Hosted Zone. If you use `name` field for private Hosted Zone, you need to add `private_zone` field to `true`.

* `zone_id` - (Optional) Hosted Zone id of the desired Hosted Zone.
* `name` - (Optional) Hosted Zone name of the desired Hosted Zone.
* `private_zone` - (Optional) Used with `name` field to get a private Hosted Zone.
* `vpc_id` - (Optional) Used with `name` field to get a private Hosted Zone associated with the vpc_id (in this case, private_zone is not mandatory).
* `tags` - (Optional) Used with `name` field. A map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match a pair on the desired Hosted Zone.

## Attribute Reference

All of the argument attributes are also exported as
result attributes. This data source will complete the data by populating
any fields that are not included in the configuration with the data for
the selected Hosted Zone.

* `name` - The Hosted Zone name.
* `name_servers` - List of DNS name servers for the Hosted Zone.
