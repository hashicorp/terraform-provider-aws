# Data Source: aws_prometheus_workspaces

Provides the aliases, ARNs, and workspace IDs of Amazon Prometheus workspaces.

## Example Usage

The following example returns all of the workspaces in a region:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_prometheus_workspaces import DataAwsPrometheusWorkspaces
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsPrometheusWorkspaces(self, "example")
```

The following example filters the workspaces by alias. Only the workspaces with
aliases that begin with the value of `alias_prefix` will be returned:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_prometheus_workspaces import DataAwsPrometheusWorkspaces
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsPrometheusWorkspaces(self, "example",
            alias_prefix="example"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `alias_prefix` - (Optional) Limits results to workspaces with aliases that begin with this value.

## Attribute Reference
