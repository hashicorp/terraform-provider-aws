# Data Source: aws_db_instances

Terraform data source for listing RDS Database Instances.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_db_instances import DataAwsDbInstances
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsDbInstances(self, "example",
            filter=[DataAwsDbInstancesFilter(
                name="db-instance-id",
                values=["my-database-id"]
            )
            ]
        )
```

### Using tags

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_db_instances import DataAwsDbInstances
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsDbInstances(self, "example",
            tags={
                "Env": "test"
            }
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are optional:

* `filter` - (Optional) Configuration block(s) used to filter instances with AWS supported attributes, such as `engine`, `db-cluster-id` or `db-instance-id` for example. Detailed below.
* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match a pair on the desired instances.

### filter Configuration block

The `filter` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the filter field. Valid values can be found in the [RDS DescribeDBClusters API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDBClusters.html) or [RDS DescribeDBInstances API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDBInstances.html).
* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given filter field. Results will be selected if any given value matches.

## Attribute Reference
