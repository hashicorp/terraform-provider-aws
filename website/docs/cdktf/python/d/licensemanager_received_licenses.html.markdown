# Data Source: aws_licensemanager_received_licenses

This resource can be used to get a set of license ARNs matching a filter.

## Example Usage

The following shows getting all license ARNs issued from the AWS marketplace. Providing no filter, would provide all license ARNs for the entire account.

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_licensemanager_received_licenses import DataAwsLicensemanagerReceivedLicenses
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsLicensemanagerReceivedLicenses(self, "test",
            filter=[DataAwsLicensemanagerReceivedLicensesFilter(
                name="IssuerName",
                values=["AWS/Marketplace"]
            )
            ]
        )
```

More complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,
