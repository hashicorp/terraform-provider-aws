## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `client_id_list` - List of client IDs (also known as audiences). When a mobile or web app registers with an OpenID Connect provider, they establish a value that identifies the application. (This is the value that's sent as the client_id parameter on OAuth requests.)

* `tags` - Map of resource tags for the IAM OIDC provider.
