# Data Source: aws_batch_scheduling_policy

The Batch Scheduling Policy data source allows access to details of a specific Scheduling Policy within AWS Batch.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_batch_scheduling_policy import DataAwsBatchSchedulingPolicy
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsBatchSchedulingPolicy(self, "test",
            arn="arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:012345678910:scheduling-policy/example"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `arn` - (Required) ARN of the scheduling policy.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `fairshare_policy` - Fairshare policy block specifies the `compute_reservation`, `share_delay_seconds`, and `share_distribution` of the scheduling policy. The `fairshare_policy` block is documented below.
* `name` - Name of the scheduling policy.
* `tags` - Key-value map of resource tags

A `fairshare_policy` block supports the following arguments:

* `compute_reservation` - Value used to reserve some of the available maximum vCPU for fair share identifiers that have not yet been used. For more information, see [FairsharePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_FairsharePolicy.html).
* `share_delay_seconds` - Time period to use to calculate a fair share percentage for each fair share identifier in use, in seconds. For more information, see [FairsharePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_FairsharePolicy.html).
* `share_distribution` - One or more share distribution blocks which define the weights for the fair share identifiers for the fair share policy. For more information, see [FairsharePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_FairsharePolicy.html). The `share_distribution` block is documented below.

A `share_distribution` block supports the following arguments:

* `share_identifier` - Fair share identifier or fair share identifier prefix. For more information, see [ShareAttributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_ShareAttributes.html).
* `weight_factor` - Weight factor for the fair share identifier. For more information, see [ShareAttributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_ShareAttributes.html).
