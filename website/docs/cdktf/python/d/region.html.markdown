# Data Source: aws_region

`aws_region` provides details about a specific AWS region.

As well as validating a given region name this resource can be used to
discover the name of the region configured within the provider. The latter
can be useful in a child module which is inheriting an AWS provider
configuration from its parent module.

## Example Usage

The following example shows how the resource might be used to obtain
the name of the AWS region configured on the provider.

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_region import DataAwsRegion
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsRegion(self, "current")
```
