# Data Source: aws_identitystore_user

Use this data source to get an Identity Store User.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Fn, Token, TerraformOutput, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.

from imports.aws.data_aws_identitystore_user import DataAwsIdentitystoreUser
from imports.aws.data_aws_ssoadmin_instances import DataAwsSsoadminInstances
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = DataAwsSsoadminInstances(self, "example")
        data_aws_identitystore_user_example = DataAwsIdentitystoreUser(self, "example_1",
            alternate_identifier=DataAwsIdentitystoreUserAlternateIdentifier(
                unique_attribute=DataAwsIdentitystoreUserAlternateIdentifierUniqueAttribute(
                    attribute_path="UserName",
                    attribute_value="ExampleUser"
                )
            ),
            identity_store_id=Token.as_string(
                Fn.lookup_nested(Fn.tolist(example.identity_store_ids), ["0"]))
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        data_aws_identitystore_user_example.override_logical_id("example")
        TerraformOutput(self, "user_id",
            value=data_aws_identitystore_user_example.user_id
        )
```

* `identity_store_id` - (Required) Identity Store ID associated with the Single Sign-On Instance.

The following arguments are optional:

* `alternate_identifier` (Optional) A unique identifier for a user or group that is not the primary identifier. Conflicts with `user_id` and `filter`. Detailed below.

* `user_id` - (Optional) The identifier for a user in the Identity Store.

-> Exactly one of the above arguments must be provided. Passing both `filter` and `user_id` is allowed for backwards compatibility.

### `alternate_identifier` Configuration Block

The `alternate_identifier` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `external_id` - (Optional) Configuration block for filtering by the identifier issued by an external identity provider. Detailed below.
* `unique_attribute` - (Optional) An entity attribute that's unique to a specific entity. Detailed below.
