class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsCodestarconnectionsConnection(self, "example",
            arn=Token.as_string(aws_codestarconnections_connection_example.arn)
        )

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `arn` - (Optional) CodeStar Connection ARN.
* `name` - (Optional) CodeStar Connection name.

~> **NOTE:** When both `arn` and `name` are specified, `arn` takes precedence.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `connection_status` - CodeStar Connection status. Possible values are `PENDING`, `AVAILABLE` and `ERROR`.
* `id` - CodeStar Connection ARN.
* `host_arn` - ARN of the host associated with the connection.
* `name` - Name of the CodeStar Connection. The name is unique in the calling AWS account.
* `provider_type` - Name of the external provider where your third-party code repository is configured. Possible values are `Bitbucket`, `GitHub` and `GitLab`. For connections to GitHub Enterprise Server or GitLab Self-Managed instances, you must create an [aws_codestarconnections_host](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/codestarconnections_host) resource and use `host_arn` instead.
* `tags` - Map of key-value resource tags to associate with the resource.
