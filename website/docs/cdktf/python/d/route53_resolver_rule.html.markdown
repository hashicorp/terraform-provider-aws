class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsRoute53ResolverRule(self, "example",

* `domain_name` - (Optional) Domain name the desired resolver rule forwards DNS queries for. Conflicts with `resolver_rule_id`.
* `name` - (Optional) Friendly name of the desired resolver rule. Conflicts with `resolver_rule_id`.
* `resolver_endpoint_id` (Optional) ID of the outbound resolver endpoint of the desired resolver rule. Conflicts with `resolver_rule_id`.
* `resolver_rule_id` (Optional) ID of the desired resolver rule. Conflicts with `domain_name`, `name`, `resolver_endpoint_id` and `rule_type`.
* `rule_type` - (Optional) Rule type of the desired resolver rule. Valid values are `FORWARD`, `SYSTEM` and `RECURSIVE`. Conflicts with `resolver_rule_id`.

* `id` - ID of the resolver rule.
* `arn` - ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the resolver rule.
* `owner_id` - When a rule is shared with another AWS account, the account ID of the account that the rule is shared with.
