# Data Source: aws_odb_db_node

Terraform data source for manging db nodes linked to cloud vm cluster of Oracle Database@AWS.

You can find out more about Oracle Database@AWS from [User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/odb/latest/UserGuide/what-is-odb.html).

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws. import DataAwsOdbDbNode
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsOdbDbNode(self, "example",
            cloud_vm_cluster_id="cloud_vm_cluster_id",
            id="db_node_id"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `cloud_vm_cluster_id` - (Required) The unique identifier of the cloud vm cluster.
* `id` - (Required) The unique identifier of db node associated with vm cluster.

The following arguments are optional:

* `region` - (Optional) Region where this resource will be [managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints). Defaults to the Region set in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#aws-configuration-reference).
