# Data Source: aws_vpc_peering_connections

Use this data source to get IDs of Amazon VPC peering connections
To get more details on each connection, use the data resource [aws_vpc_peering_connection](/docs/providers/aws/d/vpc_peering_connection.html)

Note: To use this data source in a count, the resources should exist before trying to access
the data source, as noted in [issue 4149](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/4149)

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Fn, Token, TerraformCount, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_vpc_peering_connection import DataAwsVpcPeeringConnection
from imports.aws.data_aws_vpc_peering_connections import DataAwsVpcPeeringConnections
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        pcs = DataAwsVpcPeeringConnections(self, "pcs",
            filter=[DataAwsVpcPeeringConnectionsFilter(
                name="requester-vpc-info.vpc-id",
                values=[foo.id]
            )
            ]
        )
        # In most cases loops should be handled in the programming language context and
        #     not inside of the Terraform context. If you are looping over something external, e.g. a variable or a file input
        #     you should consider using a for loop. If you are looping over something only known to Terraform, e.g. a result of a data source
        #     you need to keep this like it is.
        pc_count = TerraformCount.of(Token.as_number(Fn.length_of(pcs.ids)))
        DataAwsVpcPeeringConnection(self, "pc",
            id=Token.as_string(Fn.lookup_nested(pcs.ids, [pc_count.index])),
            count=pc_count
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The arguments of this data source act as filters for querying the available VPC peering connections.

* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.

* `tags` - (Optional) Mapping of tags, each pair of which must exactly match
  a pair on the desired VPC Peering Connection.

More complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,
which take the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by
  [the underlying AWS API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeVpcPeeringConnections.html).

* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field.
  A VPC Peering Connection will be selected if any one of the given values matches.

## Attribute Reference

All of the argument attributes except `filter` are also exported as result attributes.

* `id` - AWS Region.
* `ids` - IDs of the VPC Peering Connections.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

- `read` - (Default `20m`)
