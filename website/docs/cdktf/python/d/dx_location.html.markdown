# Data Source: aws_dx_location

Retrieve information about a specific AWS Direct Connect location in the current AWS Region.
These are the locations that can be specified when configuring [`aws_dx_connection`](/docs/providers/aws/r/dx_connection.html) or [`aws_dx_lag`](/docs/providers/aws/r/dx_lag.html) resources.

~> **Note:** This data source is different from the [`aws_dx_locations`](/docs/providers/aws/d/dx_locations.html) data source which retrieves information about all the AWS Direct Connect locations in the current AWS Region.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_dx_location import DataAwsDxLocation
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsDxLocation(self, "example",
            location_code="CS32A-24FL"
        )
```
