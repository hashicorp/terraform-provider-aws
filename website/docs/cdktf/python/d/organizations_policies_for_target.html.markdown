# Data Source: aws_organizations_policies_for_target

Terraform data source for managing an AWS Organizations Policies For Target.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Fn, Token, TerraformIterator, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_organizations_organization import DataAwsOrganizationsOrganization
from imports.aws.data_aws_organizations_policies_for_target import DataAwsOrganizationsPoliciesForTarget
from imports.aws.data_aws_organizations_policy import DataAwsOrganizationsPolicy
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = DataAwsOrganizationsOrganization(self, "example")
        data_aws_organizations_policies_for_target_example =
        DataAwsOrganizationsPoliciesForTarget(self, "example_1",
            filter="SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY",
            target_id=Token.as_string(Fn.lookup_nested(example.roots, ["0", "id"]))
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        data_aws_organizations_policies_for_target_example.override_logical_id("example")
        # In most cases loops should be handled in the programming language context and
        #     not inside of the Terraform context. If you are looping over something external, e.g. a variable or a file input
        #     you should consider using a for loop. If you are looping over something only known to Terraform, e.g. a result of a data source
        #     you need to keep this like it is.
        example_for_each_iterator = TerraformIterator.from_list(
            Token.as_any(Fn.toset(data_aws_organizations_policies_for_target_example.ids)))
        data_aws_organizations_policy_example = DataAwsOrganizationsPolicy(self, "example_2",
            policy_id=Token.as_string(example_for_each_iterator.value),
            for_each=example_for_each_iterator
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        data_aws_organizations_policy_example.override_logical_id("example")
```
