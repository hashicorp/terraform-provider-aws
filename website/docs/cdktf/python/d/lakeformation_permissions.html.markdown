# Data Source: aws_lakeformation_permissions

Get permissions for a principal to access metadata in the Data Catalog and data organized in underlying data storage such as Amazon S3. Permissions are granted to a principal, in a Data Catalog, relative to a Lake Formation resource, which includes the Data Catalog, databases, tables, LF-tags, and LF-tag policies. For more information, see [Security and Access Control to Metadata and Data in Lake Formation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/security-data-access.html).

~> **NOTE:** This data source deals with explicitly granted permissions. Lake Formation grants implicit permissions to data lake administrators, database creators, and table creators. For more information, see [Implicit Lake Formation Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/implicit-permissions.html).
