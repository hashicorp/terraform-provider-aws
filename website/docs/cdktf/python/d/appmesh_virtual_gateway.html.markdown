# Data Source: aws_appmesh_virtual_gateway

Terraform data source for managing an AWS App Mesh Virtual Gateway.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_appmesh_virtual_gateway import DataAwsAppmeshVirtualGateway
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsAppmeshVirtualGateway(self, "example",
            mesh_name="mesh-gateway",
            name="example-mesh"
        )
```

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_appmesh_virtual_gateway import DataAwsAppmeshVirtualGateway
from imports.aws.data_aws_caller_identity import DataAwsCallerIdentity
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        current = DataAwsCallerIdentity(self, "current")
        DataAwsAppmeshVirtualGateway(self, "test",
            mesh_name="example-mesh",
            mesh_owner=Token.as_string(current.account_id),
            name="example.mesh.local"
        )
```
