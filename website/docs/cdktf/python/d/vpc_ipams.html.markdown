# Data Source: aws_vpc_ipams

Terraform data source for managing VPC IPAMs.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_vpc_ipams import DataAwsVpcIpams
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsVpcIpams(self, "example",
            ipam_ids=["ipam-abcd1234"]
        )
```

### Filter by `tags`

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_vpc_ipams import DataAwsVpcIpams
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsVpcIpams(self, "example",
            filter=[DataAwsVpcIpamsFilter(
                name="tags.Some",
                values=["Value"]
            )
            ]
        )
```

### Filter by `tier`

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_vpc_ipams import DataAwsVpcIpams
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsVpcIpams(self, "example",
            filter=[DataAwsVpcIpamsFilter(
                name="tier",
                values=["free"]
            )
            ]
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `ipam_ids` - (Optional) IDs of the IPAM resources to query for.
* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.

The arguments of this data source act as filters for querying the available IPAMs.

### `filter`

More complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks, which take the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by
  [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeIpams.html).
* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field.
  An IPAM resource will be selected if any one of the given values matches.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `ipams` - List of IPAM resources matching the provided arguments.

### ipams

* `arn` - ARN of the IPAM.
* `default_resource_discovery_association_id` - The default resource discovery association ID.
* `default_resource_discovery_id` - The default resource discovery ID.
* `description` - Description for the IPAM.
* `enable_private_gua` - If private GUA is enabled.
* `id` - ID of the IPAM resource.
* `ipam_region` - Region that the IPAM exists in.
* `operating_regions` - Regions that the IPAM is configured to operate in.
* `owner_id` - ID of the account that owns this IPAM.
* `private_default_scope_id` - ID of the default private scope.
* `public_default_scope_id` - ID of the default public scope.
* `resource_discovery_association_count` - Number of resource discovery associations.
* `scope_count` - Number of scopes on this IPAM.
* `state` - Current state of the IPAM.
* `state_message` - State message of the IPAM.
* `tier` - IPAM Tier.
