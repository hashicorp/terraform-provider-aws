from imports.aws.data_aws_vpn_gateway import DataAwsVpnGateway
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        selected = DataAwsVpnGateway(self, "selected",
            filter=[DataAwsVpnGatewayFilter(
                name="tag:Name",
                values=["vpn-gw"]
            )
            ]
        )
        TerraformOutput(self, "vpn_gateway_id",
            value=selected.id
