```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Fn, Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.

from imports.aws.data_aws_identitystore_users import DataAwsIdentitystoreUsers
from imports.aws.data_aws_ssoadmin_instances import DataAwsSsoadminInstances
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = DataAwsSsoadminInstances(self, "example")
        data_aws_identitystore_users_example = DataAwsIdentitystoreUsers(self, "example_1",
            identity_store_id=Token.as_string(
                Fn.lookup_nested(Fn.tolist(example.identity_store_ids), ["0"]))
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        data_aws_identitystore_users_example.override_logical_id("example")
