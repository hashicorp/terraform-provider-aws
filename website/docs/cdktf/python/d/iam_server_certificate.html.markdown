from imports.aws.data_aws_iam_server_certificate import DataAwsIamServerCertificate
from imports.aws.elb import Elb
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        my_domain = DataAwsIamServerCertificate(self, "my-domain",
            latest=True,
            name_prefix="my-domain.org"
        )
        Elb(self, "elb",
            listener=[ElbListener(
                instance_port=8000,
                instance_protocol="https",
                lb_port=443,
                lb_protocol="https",
                ssl_certificate_id=Token.as_string(my_domain.arn)
            )
            ],
            name="my-domain-elb"
