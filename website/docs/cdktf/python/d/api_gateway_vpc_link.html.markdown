# Data Source: aws_api_gateway_vpc_link

Use this data source to get the id of a VPC Link in
API Gateway. To fetch the VPC Link you must provide a name to match against.
As there is no unique name constraint on API Gateway VPC Links this data source will
error if there is more than one match.

# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
