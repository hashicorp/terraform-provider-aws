from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.

from imports.aws.data_aws_cloudfront_origin_access_identity import DataAwsCloudfrontOriginAccessIdentity
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsCloudfrontOriginAccessIdentity(self, "example",
            id="E1ZAKK699EOLAL"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

* `id` (Required) -  The identifier for the origin access identity. For example: `E1ZAKK699EOLAL`.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `caller_reference` - Internal value used by CloudFront to allow future
   updates to the origin access identity.
* `cloudfront_access_identity_path` - A shortcut to the full path for the
   origin access identity to use in CloudFront, see below.
* `comment` - An optional comment for the origin access identity.
* `etag` - Current version of the origin access identity's information.
   For example: `E2QWRUHAPOMQZL`.
* `iam_arn` - Pre-generated ARN for use in S3 bucket policies (see below).
   Example: `arn:aws:iam::cloudfront:user/CloudFront Origin Access Identity
   E2QWRUHAPOMQZL`.
* `s3_canonical_user_id` - The Amazon S3 canonical user ID for the origin
   access identity, which you use when giving the origin access identity read
   permission to an object in Amazon S3.
