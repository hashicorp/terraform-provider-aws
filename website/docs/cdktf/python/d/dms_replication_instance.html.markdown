# Data Source: aws_dms_replication_instance

Terraform data source for managing an AWS DMS (Database Migration) Replication Instance.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_dms_replication_instance import DataAwsDmsReplicationInstance
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsDmsReplicationInstance(self, "test",
            replication_instance_id=Token.as_string(aws_dms_replication_instance_test.replication_instance_id)
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `replication_instance_id` - (Required) The replication instance identifier.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `allocated_storage` - The amount of storage (in gigabytes) to be initially allocated for the replication instance.
* `auto_minor_version_upgrade` - Indicates that minor engine upgrades will be applied automatically to the replication instance during the maintenance window.
* `availability_zone` - The EC2 Availability Zone that the replication instance will be created in.
* `engine_version` - The engine version number of the replication instance.
* `kms_key_arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS key used to encrypt the connection parameters.
* `multi_az` - Specifies if the replication instance is a multi-az deployment.
* `network_type` - The type of IP address protocol used by the replication instance.
* `preferred_maintenance_window` - The weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).
* `publicly_accessible` - Specifies the accessibility options for the replication instance. A value of true represents an instance with a public IP address. A value of false represents an instance with a private IP address.
* `replication_instance_arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replication instance.
* `replication_instance_class` - The compute and memory capacity of the replication instance as specified by the replication instance class. See [AWS DMS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_ReplicationInstance.Types.html) for information on instance classes.
* `replication_instance_private_ips` - A list of the private IP addresses of the replication instance.
* `replication_instance_public_ips` - A list of the public IP addresses of the replication instance.
* `replication_subnet_group_id` - A subnet group to associate with the replication instance.
* `vpc_security_group_ids` - A set of VPC security group IDs that are used with the replication instance.
