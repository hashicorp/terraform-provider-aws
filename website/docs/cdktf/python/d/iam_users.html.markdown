# Data Source: aws_iam_users

Use this data source to get the ARNs and Names of IAM Users.

## Example Usage

### All users in an account

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_iam_users import DataAwsIamUsers
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsIamUsers(self, "users")
```

### Users filtered by name regex

Users whose username contains `abc`

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_iam_users import DataAwsIamUsers
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsIamUsers(self, "users",
            name_regex=".*abc.*"
        )
```

### Users filtered by path prefix

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_iam_users import DataAwsIamUsers
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsIamUsers(self, "users",
            path_prefix="/custom-path"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `name_regex` - (Optional) Regex string to apply to the IAM users list returned by AWS. This allows more advanced filtering not supported from the AWS API. This filtering is done locally on what AWS returns, and could have a performance impact if the result is large. Combine this with other options to narrow down the list AWS returns.
* `path_prefix` - (Optional) Path prefix for filtering the results. For example, the prefix `/division_abc/subdivision_xyz/` gets all users whose path starts with `/division_abc/subdivision_xyz/`. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (`/`), listing all users. For more details, check out [list-users in the AWS CLI reference][1].

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arns` - Set of ARNs of the matched IAM users.
* `names` - Set of Names of the matched IAM users.
