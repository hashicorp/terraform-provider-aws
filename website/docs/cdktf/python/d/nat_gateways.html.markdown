# Data Source: aws_nat_gateways

This resource can be useful for getting back a list of NAT gateway ids to be referenced elsewhere.

## Example Usage

The following returns all NAT gateways in a specified VPC that are marked as available

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Fn, Token, TerraformCount, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_nat_gateway import DataAwsNatGateway
from imports.aws.data_aws_nat_gateways import DataAwsNatGateways
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        ngws = DataAwsNatGateways(self, "ngws",
            filter=[DataAwsNatGatewaysFilter(
                name="state",
                values=["available"]
            )
            ],
            vpc_id=vpc_id.string_value
        )
        # In most cases loops should be handled in the programming language context and
        #     not inside of the Terraform context. If you are looping over something external, e.g. a variable or a file input
        #     you should consider using a for loop. If you are looping over something only known to Terraform, e.g. a result of a data source
        #     you need to keep this like it is.
        ngw_count = TerraformCount.of(Token.as_number(Fn.length_of(ngws.ids)))
        DataAwsNatGateway(self, "ngw",
            id=Token.as_string(
                Fn.lookup_nested(Fn.tolist(ngws.ids), [ngw_count.index])),
            count=ngw_count
        )
```

## Argument Reference

* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.
* `vpc_id` - (Optional) VPC ID that you want to filter from.
* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match
  a pair on the desired NAT Gateways.

More complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,
which take the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by
  [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeNatGateways.html).
* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field.
  A Nat Gateway will be selected if any one of the given values matches.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - AWS Region.
* `ids` - List of all the NAT gateway ids found.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

- `read` - (Default `20m`)
