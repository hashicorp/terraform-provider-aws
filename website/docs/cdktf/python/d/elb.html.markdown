# aws_elb

Provides information about a "classic" Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).
See [LB Data Source](/docs/providers/aws/d/lb.html) if you are looking for "v2"
Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB).

This data source can prove useful when a module accepts an LB as an input
variable and needs to, for example, determine the security groups associated
with it, etc.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import VariableType, TerraformVariable, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_elb import DataAwsElb
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        # Terraform Variables are not always the best fit for getting inputs in the context of Terraform CDK.
        #     You can read more about this at https://cdk.tf/variables
        lb_name = TerraformVariable(self, "lb_name",
            default="",
            type=VariableType.STRING
        )
        DataAwsElb(self, "test",
            name=lb_name.string_value
        )
```

## Argument Reference
