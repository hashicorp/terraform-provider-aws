# Data Source: aws_security_groups

Use this data source to get IDs and VPC membership of Security Groups that are created outside of Terraform.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_security_groups import DataAwsSecurityGroups
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsSecurityGroups(self, "test",
            tags={
                "Application": "k8s",
                "Environment": "dev"
            }
        )
```

class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsSecurityGroups(self, "test",
            filter=[DataAwsSecurityGroupsFilter(
                name="group-name",
                values=["*nodes*"]
            ), DataAwsSecurityGroupsFilter(
                name="vpc-id",
                values=[vpc_id.string_value]
            )
            ]
        )
```

## Argument Reference

* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match for desired security groups.
* `filter` - (Optional) One or more name/value pairs to use as filters. There are several valid keys, for a full reference, check out [describe-security-groups in the AWS CLI reference][1].

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arns` - ARNs of the matched security groups.
* `id` - AWS Region.
* `ids` - IDs of the matches security groups.
* `vpc_ids` - VPC IDs of the matched security groups. The data source's tag or filter *will span VPCs* unless the `vpc-id` filter is also used.
