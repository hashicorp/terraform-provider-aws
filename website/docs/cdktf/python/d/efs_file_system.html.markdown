# Data Source: aws_efs_file_system

Provides information about an Elastic File System (EFS) File System.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import VariableType, TerraformVariable, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_efs_file_system import DataAwsEfsFileSystem
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        # Terraform Variables are not always the best fit for getting inputs in the context of Terraform CDK.
        #     You can read more about this at https://cdk.tf/variables
        file_system_id = TerraformVariable(self, "file_system_id",
            default="",
            type=VariableType.STRING
        )
        DataAwsEfsFileSystem(self, "by_id",
            file_system_id=file_system_id.string_value
        )
        DataAwsEfsFileSystem(self, "by_tag",
            tags={
                "Environment": "dev"
            }
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `region` - (Optional) Region where this resource will be [managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints). Defaults to the Region set in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#aws-configuration-reference).
* `file_system_id` - (Optional) ID that identifies the file system (e.g., fs-ccfc0d65).
* `creation_token` - (Optional) Restricts the list to the file system with this creation token.
* `tags` - (Optional) Restricts the list to the file system with these tags.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - Amazon Resource Name of the file system.
* `availability_zone_name` - The Availability Zone name in which the file system's One Zone storage classes exist.
* `availability_zone_id` - The identifier of the Availability Zone in which the file system's One Zone storage classes exist.
* `dns_name` - DNS name for the filesystem per [documented convention](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/mounting-fs-mount-cmd-dns-name.html).
* `encrypted` - Whether EFS is encrypted.
* `kms_key_id` - ARN for the KMS encryption key.
* `lifecycle_policy` - File system [lifecycle policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/API_LifecyclePolicy.html) object.
* `name` - The value of the file system's `Name` tag.
* `performance_mode` - File system performance mode.
* `provisioned_throughput_in_mibps` - The throughput, measured in MiB/s, that you want to provision for the file system.
* `tags` -A map of tags to assign to the file system.
* `throughput_mode` - Throughput mode for the file system.
* `size_in_bytes` - Current byte count used by the file system.
