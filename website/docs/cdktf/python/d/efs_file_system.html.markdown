# Data Source: aws_efs_file_system

Provides information about an Elastic File System (EFS) File System.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import VariableType, TerraformVariable, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_efs_file_system import DataAwsEfsFileSystem
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        # Terraform Variables are not always the best fit for getting inputs in the context of Terraform CDK.
        #     You can read more about this at https://cdk.tf/variables
        file_system_id = TerraformVariable(self, "file_system_id",
            default="",
            type=VariableType.STRING
        )
        DataAwsEfsFileSystem(self, "by_id",
            file_system_id=file_system_id.string_value
        )
        DataAwsEfsFileSystem(self, "by_tag",
            tags={
                "Environment": "dev"
            }
        )
```

## Argument Reference
