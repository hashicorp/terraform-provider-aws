# Data Source: aws_lb_trust_store

~> **Note:** `aws_alb_trust_store` is known as `aws_lb_trust_store`. The functionality is identical.

Provides information about a Load Balancer Trust Store.

This data source can prove useful when a module accepts an LB Trust Store as an
input variable and needs to know its attributes. It can also be used to get the ARN of
an LB Trust Store for use in other resources, given LB Trust Store name.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import VariableType, TerraformVariable, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_lb_trust_store import DataAwsLbTrustStore
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        # Terraform Variables are not always the best fit for getting inputs in the context of Terraform CDK.
        #     You can read more about this at https://cdk.tf/variables
        lb_ts_arn = TerraformVariable(self, "lb_ts_arn",
            default="",
            type=VariableType.STRING
        )
        lb_ts_name = TerraformVariable(self, "lb_ts_name",
            default="",
            type=VariableType.STRING
        )
        DataAwsLbTrustStore(self, "test",
            arn=lb_ts_arn.string_value,
            name=lb_ts_name.string_value
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `arn` - (Optional) Full ARN of the trust store.
* `name` - (Optional) Unique name of the trust store.

~> **NOTE:** When both `arn` and `name` are specified, `arn` takes precedence.

## Attribute Reference

See the [LB Trust Store Resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/lb_trust_store.html) for details
on the returned attributes - they are identical.

## Timeouts
