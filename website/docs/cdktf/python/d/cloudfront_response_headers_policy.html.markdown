# Data Source: aws_cloudfront_response_headers_policy

Use this data source to retrieve information about a CloudFront cache policy.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_cloudfront_response_headers_policy import DataAwsCloudfrontResponseHeadersPolicy
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsCloudfrontResponseHeadersPolicy(self, "example",
            name="example-policy"
        )
```

### AWS-Managed Policies

AWS managed response header policy names are prefixed with `Managed-`:
