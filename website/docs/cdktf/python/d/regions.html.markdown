# Data Source: aws_regions

Provides information about AWS Regions. Can be used to filter regions i.e., by Opt-In status or only regions enabled for current account. To get details like endpoint and description of each region the data source can be combined with the [`aws_region` data source](/docs/providers/aws/d/region.html).

## Example Usage

Enabled AWS Regions:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_regions import DataAwsRegions
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsRegions(self, "current")
```

All the regions regardless of the availability

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_regions import DataAwsRegions
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsRegions(self, "current",
            all_regions=True
        )
```

To see regions that are filtered by `"not-opted-in"`, the `all_regions` argument needs to be set to `true` or no results will be returned.

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_regions import DataAwsRegions
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsRegions(self, "current",
            all_regions=True,
            filter=[DataAwsRegionsFilter(
                name="opt-in-status",
                values=["not-opted-in"]
            )
            ]
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `all_regions` - (Optional) If true the source will query all regions regardless of availability.

* `filter` - (Optional) Configuration block(s) to use as filters. Detailed below.

### filter Configuration Block

The `filter` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the filter field. Valid values can be found in the [describe-regions AWS CLI Reference][1].
* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given filter field. Results will be selected if any given value matches.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - Identifier of the current partition (e.g., `aws` in AWS Commercial, `aws-cn` in AWS China).
* `names` - Names of regions that meets the criteria.
