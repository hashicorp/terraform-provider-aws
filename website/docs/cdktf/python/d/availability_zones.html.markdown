# Data Source: aws_availability_zones

The Availability Zones data source allows access to the list of AWS
Availability Zones which can be accessed by an AWS account within the region
configured in the provider.

This is different from the `aws_availability_zone` (singular) data source,
which provides some details about a specific availability zone.

-> When [Local Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/) are enabled in a region, by default the API and this data source include both Local Zones and Availability Zones. To return only Availability Zones, see the example section below.

## Example Usage

### By State

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Fn, Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_availability_zones import DataAwsAvailabilityZones
from imports.aws.subnet import Subnet
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name, *, vpcId, vpcId1):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        available = DataAwsAvailabilityZones(self, "available",
            state="available"
        )
        Subnet(self, "primary",
            availability_zone=Token.as_string(Fn.lookup_nested(available.names, ["0"])),
            vpc_id=vpc_id
        )
        Subnet(self, "secondary",
            availability_zone=Token.as_string(Fn.lookup_nested(available.names, ["1"])),
            vpc_id=vpc_id1
        )
```

### By Filter

All Local Zones (regardless of opt-in status):

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_availability_zones import DataAwsAvailabilityZones
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsAvailabilityZones(self, "example",
            all_availability_zones=True,
            filter=[DataAwsAvailabilityZonesFilter(
                name="opt-in-status",
                values=["not-opted-in", "opted-in"]
            )
            ]
        )
```

Only Availability Zones (no Local Zones):

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_availability_zones import DataAwsAvailabilityZones
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsAvailabilityZones(self, "example",
            filter=[DataAwsAvailabilityZonesFilter(
                name="opt-in-status",
                values=["opt-in-not-required"]
            )
            ]
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `all_availability_zones` - (Optional) Set to `true` to include all Availability Zones and Local Zones regardless of your opt in status.
* `filter` - (Optional) Configuration block(s) for filtering. Detailed below.
* `exclude_names` - (Optional) List of Availability Zone names to exclude.
* `exclude_zone_ids` - (Optional) List of Availability Zone IDs to exclude.
* `state` - (Optional) Allows to filter list of Availability Zones based on their
current state. Can be either `"available"`, `"information"`, `"impaired"` or
`"unavailable"`. By default the list includes a complete set of Availability Zones
to which the underlying AWS account has access, regardless of their state.

### filter Configuration Block

The `filter` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the filter field. Valid values can be found in the [EC2 DescribeAvailabilityZones API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAvailabilityZones.html).
* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given filter field. Results will be selected if any given value matches.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `group_names` A set of the Availability Zone Group names. For Availability Zones, this is the same value as the Region name. For Local Zones, the name of the associated group, for example `us-west-2-lax-1`.
* `id` - Region of the Availability Zones.
* `names` - List of the Availability Zone names available to the account.
* `zone_ids` - List of the Availability Zone IDs available to the account.

Note that the indexes of Availability Zone names and IDs correspond.

## Timeouts
