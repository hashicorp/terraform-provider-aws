# Data Source: aws_elastic_beanstalk_solution_stack

Use this data source to get the name of a elastic beanstalk solution stack.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_elastic_beanstalk_solution_stack import DataAwsElasticBeanstalkSolutionStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsElasticBeanstalkSolutionStack(self, "multi_docker",
            most_recent=True,
            name_regex="^64bit Amazon Linux (.*) Multi-container Docker (.*)$"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

* `most_recent` - (Optional) If more than one result is returned, use the most
recent solution stack.

* `name_regex` - Regex string to apply to the solution stack list returned
by AWS. See [Elastic Beanstalk Supported Platforms][beanstalk-platforms] from
AWS documentation for reference solution stack names.

~> **NOTE:** If more or less than a single match is returned by the search,
Terraform will fail. Ensure that your search is specific enough to return
a single solution stack, or use `most_recent` to choose the most recent one.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `name` - Name of the solution stack.
