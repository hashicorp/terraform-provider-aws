# Data Source: aws_networkfirewall_firewall_policy

Retrieve information about a firewall policy.

## Example Usage

### Find firewall policy by name

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_networkfirewall_firewall_policy import DataAwsNetworkfirewallFirewallPolicy
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsNetworkfirewallFirewallPolicy(self, "example",
            name=firewall_policy_name.string_value
        )
```

### Find firewall policy by ARN

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_networkfirewall_firewall_policy import DataAwsNetworkfirewallFirewallPolicy
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsNetworkfirewallFirewallPolicy(self, "example",
            arn=firewall_policy_arn.string_value
        )
```

### Find firewall policy by name and ARN

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_networkfirewall_firewall_policy import DataAwsNetworkfirewallFirewallPolicy
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsNetworkfirewallFirewallPolicy(self, "example",
            arn=firewall_policy_arn.string_value,
            name=firewall_policy_name.string_value
        )
```

AWS Network Firewall does not allow multiple firewall policies with the same name to be created in an account. It is possible, however, to have multiple firewall policies available in a single account with identical `name` values but distinct `arn` values, e.g. firewall policies shared via a [Resource Access Manager (RAM) share][1]. In that case specifying `arn`, or `name` and `arn`, is recommended.

~> **Note:** If there are multiple firewall policies in an account with the same `name`, and `arn` is not specified, the default behavior will return the firewall policy with `name` that was created in the account.

## Argument Reference

* `name` - Descriptive name of the firewall policy.

One or more of these arguments is required.

## Attribute Reference
