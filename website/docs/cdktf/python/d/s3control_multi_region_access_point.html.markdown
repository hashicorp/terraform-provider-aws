    * PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.
    * PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.
* `block_public_policy` - Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket policies for buckets in this account. When set to `true` causes Amazon S3 to:
    * Reject calls to PUT Bucket policy if the specified bucket policy allows public access.
* `ignore_public_acls` - Specifies whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for buckets in this account. When set to `true` causes Amazon S3 to:
    * Ignore all public ACLs on buckets in this account and any objects that they contain.
* `restrict_public_buckets` - Specifies whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket policies for buckets in this account. When set to `true`:
    * Only the bucket owner and AWS Services can access buckets with public policies.
