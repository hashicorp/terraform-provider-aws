# Data Source: aws_lb_target_group

~> **Note:** `aws_alb_target_group` is known as `aws_lb_target_group`. The functionality is identical.

Provides information about a Load Balancer Target Group.

This data source can prove useful when a module accepts an LB Target Group as an
input variable and needs to know its attributes. It can also be used to get the ARN of
an LB Target Group for use in other resources, given LB Target Group name.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import VariableType, TerraformVariable, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_lb_target_group import DataAwsLbTargetGroup
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        # Terraform Variables are not always the best fit for getting inputs in the context of Terraform CDK.
        #     You can read more about this at https://cdk.tf/variables
        lb_tg_arn = TerraformVariable(self, "lb_tg_arn",
            default="",
            type=VariableType.STRING
        )
        lb_tg_name = TerraformVariable(self, "lb_tg_name",
            default="",
            type=VariableType.STRING
        )
        DataAwsLbTargetGroup(self, "test",
            arn=lb_tg_arn.string_value,
            name=lb_tg_name.string_value
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This data source supports the following arguments:

* `region` - (Optional) Region where this resource will be [managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints). Defaults to the Region set in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#aws-configuration-reference).
* `arn` - (Optional) Full ARN of the target group.
* `name` - (Optional) Unique name of the target group.
* `tags` - (Optional) Mapping of tags, each pair of which must exactly match a pair on the desired target group.

~> **NOTE:** When both `arn` and `name` are specified, `arn` takes precedence. `tags` has the lowest precedence.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

See the [LB Target Group Resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/lb_target_group.html) for details
on the returned attributes - they are identical.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

- `read` - (Default `20m`)
